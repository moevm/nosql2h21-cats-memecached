    "childrenAndPets": "The active and social Abyssinian is a perfect choice for families with children and cat-friendly dogs. He will play fetch as well as any retriever, learns tricks easily and loves the attention he receives from children who treat him politely and with respect. He\u2019s smart enough to get out of the way of toddlers but loves school-age children because they are a match for his energy level and curiosity. Nothing scares him, certainly not dogs, and he will happily make friends with them if they don\u2019t give him any trouble. Abys have also been known to get along with large parrots, ferrets and other animals. Always introduce any pets, even other cats, slowly and in a controlled setting.",
    "colorAndGrooming": "The Aby is often said to look as if he had just walked straight out of the wild. That\u2019s because of his ticked coat pattern, which resembles that of wild cats such as cougars. A ticked coat has alternating light and dark bands of color on each hair shaft.\n\nEverything about him suggests his lively, attentive nature. The Aby has a slightly rounded wedge-shaped head topped with large, broad ears, the better to hear you with. Large, almond-shaped eyes of gold or green express interest in everything they see. On the face, dark lines may extend from the eyes and brows.\n\nThe muscular body is graceful and athletic. It falls into a middle ground between the stocky, or cobby, body of a breed such as the Persian and the long, svelte body of the Oriental breeds such as the Siamese. The body is supported by slim, fine-boned legs atop small, oval, compact paws. Abys are often said to look as if they are walking on tip-toe. Swishing behind them is a long, tapering tail.\n\nIts bands of color give the Aby\u2019s coat a warm, glowing appearance. To the touch, the medium-length hair is soft and silky with a fine texture.\n\nThe coat comes in four main colors: ruddy brown, more artistically described as burnt sienna and ticked with darker brown or black, with tile-red nose leather and black or brown paw pads; red (sometimes called sorrel), a cinnamon shade ticked with chocolate-brown, with pink nose leather and paw pads; blue, a warm beige ticked with various shades of slate blue, with nose leather described as old rose and paw pads as mauve; and fawn, a warm rose-beige ticked with light cocoa-brown, with salmon-colored nose leather and pink paw pads. Some associations permit additional colors, including chocolate, lilac, and various silver tones.",
    "health": "Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Problems that may affect the Abyssinian include the following:\n\n\u00a0\n\nEarly-onset periodontal disease\n\nHyperesthesia syndrome, a neurological problem that can cause cats to excessively groom themselves, leading to hair loss, and to act frantically, especially when they are touched or petted\n\nPatellar luxation, a hereditary dislocation of the kneecap that can range from mild to severe. Severe cases can be alleviated with surgery.\n\nProgressive retinal atrophy, a degenerative eye disease.\n\nPyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD), for which a genetic test is available to identify carriers.\n\nRenal amyloidosis, a heritable disease that occurs when a type of protein called amyloid is deposited in body organs, primarily the kidneys in Abyssinians. It eventually leads to kidney failure.",
    "history": "Showing cats was all the rage in the late Victorian era. One of the unusual breeds exhibited at the Crystal Palace Cat Show in 1871 was an Abyssinian \u2014 \u201ccaptured in the late Abyssinian War\u201d \u2014 who took third place. The report on the cat show, published in the January 27, 1872, issue of Harper\u2019s Weekly, was the first known mention in print of the breed. Unfortunately, no records exist regarding the cats\u2019 origins, although myths and speculation abound, including claims that it was the cat of the pharaohs, and that it was created in Britain by crossing silver and brown tabbies with cats that had \u201cticked\u201d coats.\n\nToday, genetic evidence suggests that the cats came from Indian Ocean coastal regions and parts of Southeast Asia. British and Dutch traders may well have brought the cats from ports such as Calcutta, India, or the islands of Indonesia. A taxidermied specimen of a ruddy ticked cat exhibited in the 1830s at the Leiden Zoological Museum in The Netherlands, where he was labeled \u201cPatrie, domestica India,\u201d gives creedence to that theory. The cats were probably given the name Abyssinian because Zula, the cat exhibited at the Crystal Palace, was said to have been imported from Abyssinia (now Ethiopia). Early pedigrees show crosses to non-Abyssinian cats, which may explain the introduction of new coat colors and the gene for long hair.\n\nAmerican cat fanciers first imported some Abyssinians in 1900, but Abyssinian breeding programs didn\u2019t get a real start in the United States until the 1930s, when more of the cats were imported from Britain. It\u2019s a good thing that a number of cats were exported to the U.S. because World War II devastated the breed. Only a dozen of the cats had survived in England by the end of the war. The breed bounced back, however, and has become one of the most popular cat breeds.",
    "personality": "Of all the cat breeds, the Abyssinian is perhaps the one who lives life to the fullest. He climbs higher, jumps farther, plays harder. Nothing escapes the notice of this highly intelligent and inquisitive cat, a quality that makes life with him both endlessly entertaining and continuously challenging. Staying a step ahead of an Aby, as the breed is nicknamed, or even just keeping pace with him, requires the fancy footwork of a Fred Astaire, the brainpower of an Einstein and a sense of humor that never stops. You never know what he\u2019ll get into next, although you can assume that if you have something or are doing something, your Aby will want to investigate it closely. Some people refer to the cats as \u201cAby-grabbys\u201d because of their propensity for taking things that catch their interest.\n\nSometimes it may seem as if the Aby never sleeps. He is ever in motion, jumping up in the window to look at birds or squirrels, leaping on top of the refrigerator to supervise meal preparation, perching on your desk to watch your fingers move over the keyboard and then swiping at them so you\u2019ll pay attention to him instead. This is a playful, persistent cat who adores being the center of attention and will do anything to achieve and maintain that status.\n\nThe Aby loves to play, so plan on making or purchasing a variety of toys to keep him occupied. Ping-Pong balls, bottle caps, wadded-up pieces of paper, puzzle toys and teasers such as big peacock feathers will all amuse this busy and brainy cat. Teach him to retrieve at your peril. Once you start, he won\u2019t let you stop. He learns tricks quickly and many Abys enjoy running a feline agility course.\n\nA love of heights is a signal trait of the Abyssinian. He likes to be as high up as possible and will appreciate having one or more ceiling-height cat trees. When those aren\u2019t available, he is perfectly capable of making his way to the uppermost point of any room. Fortunately, he is naturally graceful and rarely breaks items unless it is simply out of curiosity.\n\nAbys are adaptable throughout their lives and fit well into any home where they are loved and given plenty of attention. In a home where people are at work or school during the day, the Aby does best with a companion, ideally another Aby, who can match his activity level. If left to his own devices, the Aby may well dismantle the house in his search for something interesting to do.\n\nBeware! The Aby can be addictive. Once you\u2019ve had one, you may find that no other cat will do.",

While the Aegean has an independent streak, they do best in a bustling household where there's always activity going on that the cat can check out. This breed loves to be part of the action!\n\nThe Aegean also has a love of being outdoors, so if you can provide a safely-enclosed catio, they'll very much appreciate it.

He ranges in size from medium to large and matures slowly, taking up to three years to reach his full size.\n\nSince this breed is distinguished by his short tail, it\u2019s as good a place as any to begin a description of his looks. Each tail is unique. Most are 1 to 4 inches long, but they can be shorter or longer. The ideal bobtail is flexible and expressive, long enough to be visible above the back when the cat is alert, and may be straight with a fat pad at the end, slightly curved or kinked, or bumpy along the length of the tail. Kittens are almost never completely tailless, as sometimes happens with the Manx. Some litters have kittens with full-length tails. They won\u2019t be stars in the show ring, but they can be used in breeding programs.\n\nThe noticeably athletic body is covered with shaggy fur in two lengths. The shorthaired American Bobtail actually has a medium-length double coat with hard outer hairs overlaying a soft, downy undercoat.When the coat is a dilute color, a lynx point or a silver, the coat may have a softer texture. Longhaired Bobtails have a ruff around the neck and long hair on the britches (upper hind legs), belly and tail. On the face, the longhair may look as if he is sporting mutton chops. The fur comes in all colors and patterns. The eyes can be any color except odd (each eye a different color).",
    "health": "Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. American Bobtails are generally healthy.",
    "history": "Bobtailed cats, the result of a natural genetic mutation that causes a shortened tail, have appeared in various places over the centuries, from Japan to the Isle of Man. Sometimes they get noticed by the right people, and voila! A new breed is born. Such was the case with the American Bobtail, which descends from a short-tailed kitten acquired by John and Brenda Sanders during a vacation to Arizona. They named him Yodi, and he became the father of the breed in the swinging \u201860s when he had his way with the Sanders\u2019 female, Mishi, once they arrived back home in Iowa.\n\nYodi and Mishi\u2019s kittens had short tails, too, a clue that the trait was caused by a dominant gene. Family friend Mindy Shoultz, who\u2019d had experience breeding Persians, partnered with Charlotte Bentley to develop the unusual cats into a breed. They bred the kittens to other cats with naturally short tails that were found in various places throughout the United States and Canada.\u00a0 They selectively bred the cats to be big and sturdy with a wild look but a sweet temper. All of the cats used to develop the breed were non-pedigreed domestic shorthairs and longhairs. Now, after 50 years, such outcrossing is no longer necessary because now the cats have pedigrees longer than their tails.\n\nThe International Cat Association accepted the American Bobtail into its new breed category in 1989 and gave it full recognition in 2002. The American Bobtail is also recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association and the American Cat Fanciers Association.",
    "personality": "Let\u2019s say you love the Golden Retriever\u2019s personality, but his size and energy level are a bit more than you can handle. American Bobtail lovers say you should take a look at their cat instead. He\u2019s a lover with a heart of gold who is devoted to his people, follows them around, loves to play, walks nicely on a leash (after training, of course), and welcomes guests with a smile.\n\nThis is a smart cat who enjoys puzzle toys, learning tricks, and playing fetch. He isn\u2019t as vocal as some breeds, but he communicates his pleasure with chirps, clicks and trills, as well as the standard purr and meow.\n\nThe American Bobtail has an adaptable nature, so he\u2019s a good traveler. Long-distance truckers and Rvers find him to be an excellent companion. The cats have also found a niche with some psychotherapists because of their loving and intuitive nature. That same adaptability and kindness makes him a good family companion and suited to a variety of lifestyles, from relaxed to rowdy.",

    "history": "The American Curl is one of the youngest cat breeds. It was born of a natural genetic mutation that first appeared in Shulamith, a stray black kitten with long, silky hair and, strangely, ears that curled backward. She found her way to the welcoming door of Joe and Grace Ruga in Lakewood, California. The Rugas named her Shulamith after the \u201cblack and comely\u201d princess in the Old Testament book the Song of Solomon.\n\nShulamith had a litter of four kittens by an unknown father, and two of them shared her curly ears. A consultation with a geneticist showed that the trait was caused by a dominant gene. Cat fanciers began selectively breeding the cats in 1983, and the new breed, named the American Curl, began to be registered by the Cat Fanciers Association in 1986. They were recognized by The International Cat Association in 1987 and achieved full recognition from CFA in 1993. With almost unheard-of rapidity, the trip from stray to pedigreed breed took only six years. The breed also stands out for being the first single breed with two coat lengths recognized by CFA.\n\nAll American Curls are descended from Shulamith. The cats can be bred to other Curls or outcrossed to non-pedigreed domestic cats with straight ears that otherwise meet the Curl breed standard. This helps to ensure a large gene pool and genetic diversity. Straight-eared kittens from American Curl litters can be used in breeding programs or placed as pets.",
    "personality": "The friendly and gentle American Curl is known for his people-loving personality. He even likes children, which is not always the case with cats, and has been known to seek out their company. True to to his domestic shorthair heritage, he is moderately active, curious and smart. He is likely to follow you around to see what you\u2019re doing, but he\u2019s not talkative or bossy like some breeds. If need be, he will quietly petition you for attention, food or whatever else he wants. When you come home from work, he will gladly greet you with a head bump and may even extend the affectionate gesture to guests in the home.\n\nAmerican Curls are often called the \u201cPeter Pan\u201d of the cat world. It is not unusual to see older Curls flying through the house with just as much joy as younger ones. Males and females are equally active.\n\nThe Curl likes to play and can learn to fetch. He\u2019s also capable of opening doorknobs, so be careful what you put away in any cabinets that are within his reach. When he\u2019s ready for a break, he will happily settle into a lap.

Cats are very particular about bathroom hygiene, and a dirty box may cause them to start using other places in the house instead.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to keep an American Shorthair as an indoor-only cat to protect him from diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car.

    "history": "They aren\u2019t listed on the manifest, but cats were undoubtedly among the passengers and crew that disembarked from the Mayflower when it arrived at Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1620. Their ratting abilities made cats valued members of ships\u2019 crews, and they may well have made their way to the New World even earlier, on ships that carried settlers to the Jamestown colony in Virginia, Spanish explorers to Florida and Vikings to Newfoundland. Some of the descendants of those seafaring cats, known prosaically as shorthairs, or domestic shorthairs, became what we know today as American Shorthairs.\n\nCats were valued on land as well as at sea. Farmers, shopkeepers and householders all needed a good cat to protect their stores of food from mice, rats and other vermin. The shorthairs were solid, hardy working stock, well suited to the tough conditions that prevailed on the untamed continent. Such good hunters were they that a publication from 1634 credits them with saving a New England colony\u2019s crops from squirrels and chipmunks. From their coastal arrival points, they went west with settlers, and thrived.\n\nBy 1895, shorthairs had made enough of a mark that they were exhibited at the first cat show in the United States. The Cat Fanciers Association recognized them as a breed in 1906. To differentiate them from randombred cats, also known as domestic shorthairs, the pedigreed felines were given the name American Shorthair in 1966. The cats are recognized by all registries.",

As befits a working class cat who has made good, he is smart and enjoys playing with puzzle toys and interactive toys. He has a sociable nature and isn\u2019t the type to hide under the bed when visitors arrive. This is a placid cat but one that doesn\u2019t especially like being carried around. Let him stand on his own four feet. He may or may not be a lap cat, but he will always appreciate having a spot next to you on the sofa or at the end of the bed.",

    "history": "This cat is an American original. It\u2019s not unusual for natural mutations to pop up in cats in different places around the world, but so far the mutation for a wiry coat has appeared only in the United States. It was first seen in 1966, in a litter of kittens born to a domestic shorthair cat in upstate New York. The only kitten to survive from that litter was a red tabby and white male. Because of his unusual coat, the owners showed him to a local cat breeder, Joan O\u2019Shea, who purchased the kinky-coated kitten for $50, named him Council Rock Adam of Hi-Fi and set about trying to reproduce him through crosses to American Shorthairs.\n\nThe American Wirehair achieved full recognition from the Cat Fanciers Association in 1978. In The International Cat Association, the breed is considered a type of American Shorthair. American Wirehairs are also recognized by the American Cat Fanciers Association, the Canadian Cat Association, \u00a0and the World Cat Federation.

    "history": "The Australian Mist was originally developed back in 1977 by a doctor named Truda Straede. The intention behind the mixed breed was to develop a cat that would be content to stay indoors, along with having a mellow personality and easy going nature.\n\nThese days, the Australian Mist has become honored as Australia's national cat! In 1998, the breed's name was changed from the Spotted Mist to the Australian Mist.\n\nThe Australian Mist was officially accepted as having gained championship status by the International Cat Association (TICA) in 2014.\n\nThese days, you can find Australian Mists in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. So make sure to consider adoption if you decide that this is the breed for you!",
    "personality": "When people talk about the personality of their Australian Mist cats, they usually say that they're mellow and tolerant kitties with an exceptionally loving side. These cats adore human interaction and attention and will often follow you around or hop up on your lap at any opportunity.\n\nIf you're after a cat who snuggles, this is an excellent mixed breed to consider. As the Australian Mist was originally developed to be an indoor cat, they're pretty adaptable to most living situations. Just be sure that you provide enough smart interactive toys and pieces of cat-friendly furniture around the home environment to ensure that the feline doesn't become bored or frustrated.\n\nDue to the mixed breed's very tolerant nature, they also do really well living in an active household and are fine with lots of children around the place. It's often remarked that the Australian Mist is a cat who enjoys being handled and will rarely scratch.",

    "history": "Named for the exotically graceful dancers on the Indonesian island of Bali, the Balinese is a longhaired variety of Siamese.\u00a0 It is unknown whether the long hair is the result of a natural mutation or a cross between the Siamese and a longhaired breed such as a Persian or Turkish Angora. Although longhaired Siamese appeared earlier, the cats did not begin to be developed as a breed until the 1940s and 1950s. The Cat Fanciers Federation recognized the Balinese in 1961, followed by the Cat Fanciers Association in 1970. They are also recognized by the American Cat Fanciers Association and The International Cat Association, as well as other cat registries. Balinese can be outcrossed to Javanese, Siamese, Colorpoint Shorthairs and Oriental Longhairs.",
    "personality": "The Siamese and the Balinese might differ in coat length, but beneath the skin they are identical. Balinese are extremely fond of their people. They like to be \u201chelpful\u201d and will follow you around and supervise your every move. When you are sitting down, a Balinese will be in your lap, and at night he will be in bed with you, probably under the covers with his head on the pillow. He is frequently underfoot, so he might not be the best choice for people who are unsteady on their feet or use a walker or cane.\n\nA Balinese is perhaps not quite as loud as his relative the Siamese, but he is most definitely just as\u00a0opinionated. He will tell you exactly what he thinks, and he expects you to pay attention and act on his advice. You can also count on him to \u201ctell all\u201d to visitors, so be grateful that most people are not conversant in the Balinese language.\n\nThe Balinese is highly intelligent, agile and athletic, and loves to play. Keep his busy brain active with puzzle toys and his body exercised with teaser toys that he can chase and a big cat tree he can climb. He likes to play fetch, is willing to walk on a leash, and learns tricks easily. He is also a good trainer himself and may be running your household before you know it. Never leave him without any form of entertainment, or you will likely come home to find that he has reprogrammed your DVR to record only nature shows or at the very least decided that your toilet paper rolls and tissue boxes look better empty.\n\nDo not get a Balinese if living with a chatty busybody would drive you insane. On the other hand, if you enjoy having someone to talk to throughout the day, the Balinese can be your best friend. Just be sure you have time to spend with this demanding and social cat. Balinese don\u2019t mind staying home during the day while you go off to earn money to buy cat food, but they will expect you to devote time to them when you are at home. It can be smart to get two of them so they can keep each other company.\n\nChoose a Balinese if you look forward to spending time with and interacting with your cat. This is a loyal and loving feline who will pout and pine if given little or no attention. In the right home, however, he thrives for years.",

    "history": "With his distinctive spotted coat and large size, the Bengal looks like a wild cat on the prowl, but although one of his ancestors is the small, wild Asian leopard cat, he\u2019s a domestic cat through and through.\n\nBengals take their name from the Asian leopard cat\u2019s scientific name, Felis bengalensis. They were created through crosses between an Asian leopard cat \u2014 which in the 1950s and into the 1960s could be purchased at pet stores \u2014 and domestic shorthairs. Jean Mill, a breeder in California, was the first to make such a cross, but not because she wanted to create a new breed. She had acquired a leopard cat and allowed her to keep company with a black tom cat so she wouldn\u2019t be lonely. To her surprise, since she hadn\u2019t thought the two species would mate, kittens resulted, and Mill kept a spotted female. Breeding her back to her father produced a litter of spotted and solid kittens.\n\nAt about the same time, Dr. Willard Centerwall was crossing Asian leopard cats with domestic cats at Loyola University. The leopard cats were resistant to the feline leukemia virus, so researchers were interested in finding out if the trait could be passed on to hybrid offspring.\n\nVarious breeders became interested in developing the cats as a breed. Mill was one of them. Changes in her life had caused her to give up cat breeding, but she was ready to begin again. She had acquired some of Dr. Centerwall\u2019s hybrids and sought out suitable males to breed to them. One was an orange domestic shorthair that she found in India, of all places, and the other was a brown spotted tabby acquired from a shelter. Bengals today are considered to be one and the same with domestic cats, and any Bengal purchased should be at least four generations removed from any ancestors with wild bloodlines.\n\nThe first cat association to recognize the Bengal was The International Cat Association, which granted the breed experimental status in 1983, followed by full recognition in 1991. The Bengal is also recognized by the American Cat Fanciers Association, the Canadian Cat Association and the United Feline Organization.\n\nBengal cats are so sought after, that a British woman paid over $50,000 for her bengal cat in 1990, dubbing them the \"Rolls Royce\" of feline companions.",
    "personality": "The Bengal is highly active and highly intelligent. This makes him fun to live with, but he can sometimes be challenging. On the whole, the Bengal is a confident, talkative, friendly cat who is always alert. Nothing escapes his notice. He likes to play games, including fetch, and he\u2019s a whiz at learning tricks. His nimble paws are almost as good as hands, and it\u2019s a good thing he doesn\u2019t have opposable thumbs or he would probably rule the world. Bored bengal cats can also adopt some unconventional (and slightly destructive) habits, including: turning light switches on and off, fishing seals out of drains and excitedly plucking CDs from your DVD player.\n\nFond of playing in water, the Bengal is not above jumping into the tub or strolling into the shower with you. Aquarium and pond fish may be at risk from his clever paws. He also loves to climb and can often be found perching at the highest point he can reach in the home. A tall cat tree or two is a must for this feline, as are puzzle toys that will challenge his intelligence.\n\nOn the rare occasions that he isn\u2019t swinging on chandeliers or swimming in your pool, the affectionate Bengal will be pleased to sit on your lap.

This is a medium-size to large cat with a stocky, powerful body that belies his gentle demeanor.\n\nThe medium-long to long coat has a silky texture and little undercoat, which means that it rarely mats. It forms a heavy ruff around the neck and is wavy on the belly.\n\nA pale body, which varies in shade depending on the cat\u2019s color, is set off by darker points. For instance, a seal point Birman has a body that is a pale fawn to cream color with a warm tone, gradually shading to a lighter color on the belly and chest. The points are a deep seal brown. On the front and back paws are white \u201cgloves\u201d ending in an even line across the paw. On the back paws, the gloves extend up the back of the leg (called laces) and end in a point or an inverted V shape. In the show ring, the symmetry of the \u201cgloves and laces\u201d are an important factor and may mean the difference between a kitten going on to a career as a show cat or as a pet.\n\nBesides seal point, Birmans come in blue point, chocolate point, lilac point, and various parti-color point and lynx point colors. Lynx point Birmans have a clearly defined M marking on the forehead, light markings that resemble eyeglasses around the eyes, spotted whisker pads, solid-colored ears with no stripes, and \u201cthumb marks\u201d on the back of the ears.

Fortunately, these conditions are rare.\n\nCorneal dermoid, the presence of skin and hair on the surface of the cornea (the clear front of the eye) of one or both eyes. It can be corrected surgically.\n\nSpongiform degeneration, a progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system causing signs that include hind-limb weakness and uncoordinated movement.\n\nShaking and trembling in kittens.

    "history": "A beautiful cat deserves a beautiful legend of origin. The Sacred Cat of Burma, as the Birman is sometimes called, is said to have acquired his striking appearance through the intervention of a blue-eyed goddess, who rewarded a temple cat\u2019s love for and devotion to his priest by turning his white coat golden and changing his yellow eyes to blue. His paws remained white as a symbol of his purity. Ever since, the temple cats have borne the goddess\u2019s marks of favor, and it was said that priests who died were reborn into the cats\u2019 bodies.\n\nHow the cats really came to be is unknown. Theories include crosses of Siamese with Angoras or Persians, but when or where those original meetups occurred is unknown. They may have taken place in southeast Asia, between various cats who carried the genes for a pointed pattern, long hair and blue eyes, or the breed may have been created in France from cats imported by two Europeans, a Frenchman named Auguste Pavie, and a Major Gordon Russell, who were given a pair of temple cats in 1919 as a reward for aiding the priests. The cats were shipped to France, but the male did not make it there alive. Before he died, however, he had impregnated the female, and her kittens helped to establish the breed in Europe. It was recognized in France in 1925 as the Sacre de Birmanie, from which comes the current breed name, Birman.\n\nThe cats were first imported to the United States in 1959 and were recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association in 1967. They are also recognized by the American Cat Fanciers Association, the Canadian Cat Association, the Cat Fanciers Federation and The International Cat Association.",

The Birman is a smart cat and, of course, curious. He likes to explore his environment and has been known to get trapped underneath floors that are being replaced or to accidentally (maybe on purpose) go for a ride on top of a car. It\u2019s a good idea to always keep tabs on where he is.\n\nHe communicates in a soft voice, mainly to remind you that perhaps it\u2019s time for dinner or maybe for a nice cuddle on the sofa. He enjoys being held and will relax in your arms like a furry baby.",

A bath is rarely necessary.\n\nBrush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don\u2019t run the risk of spreading any infection.

It is not unheard of for Bombays to reach sexual maturity as early as 5 months of age.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to keep a Bombay as an indoor-only cat to protect him from diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car.

Those kittens are euthanized, so people who are buying Bombay kittens will not encounter the problem, but breeders should research pedigrees carefully to make sure they don\u2019t breed cats who carry the gene for the defect.",
    "history": "Cat breeders are an experimental lot, creating distinctive new breeds either by building on natural genetic mutations or by crossing breeds to achieve a new look, color or pattern. The Bombay, named for the exotic port city of India, has no connection with the subcontinent but was created from crosses between sable Burmese and black American Shorthairs to resemble a black panther in miniature.\n\nBreeder Nikki Horner of Louisville, Kentucky, is credited with developing the Bombay, starting in the late 1950s. Her goal was a sleek, shiny black cat with a muscular body and friendly temperament. British breeders achieved the same look and personality with crosses of Burmese and black domestic shorthairs.\n\nThe Cat Fanciers Association gave the Bombay full recognition in 1978. Today the breed is recognized by all cat associations. To maintain their body type and coat texture, Bombays may be outcrossed to sable Burmese. The CFA also permits outcrosses to black American Shorthairs, but this is rarely done because of differences in body type.",

    "history": "The ancestors of the Burmese are the Siamese and the \u201ccopper cat\u201d of Burma (now known as Myanmar). It\u2019s thought that they were temple and palace cats bred and kept by priests. The matriarch of the modern Burmese was a small, dark-brown cat named Wong Mau. She belonged to Dr. Joseph Thompson, who either acquired her from a sailor or brought her back himself from his travels, depending on which story you believe.\n\nWong Mau was at first thought to be a Siamese with a chocolate-colored coat. Such Siamese weren\u2019t unheard of. \u201cChocolate Siamese\u201d were described in the 1880s. Their bodies were tan or brown, and they had seal-brown or nearly black points. The seal-point Siamese, also known as royal Siamese, had lighter bodies that contrasted with their dark points and were preferred by breeders and the public. The chocolate-colored cats eventually disappeared in Britain, but they still existed in Thailand and Burma (now known as Myanmar), where they were probably the offspring of natural (as opposed to human-directed) matings between free-roaming Siamese (pointed) and solid-colored Burmese cats. Wong Mau was one of them. It was her destiny to become the matriarch of two new breeds: the Burmese and, later, the Tonkinese.\n\nDr. Thompson bred Wong Mau to a seal-point Siamese named Tai Mau. His breeding program, in conjunction with breeders Virginia Cobb and Billie Gerst and geneticist Clyde Keeler, produced kittens with beige, brown and pointed coats. The results, including the discovery of the Burmese gene, were so interesting that Thompson published an article on the subject in a 1943 issue of the Journal of Heredity, the first such piece on feline genetics.\n\nThe Cat Fanciers Association began registering Burmese in 1936 but suspended registrations in 1947 because breeders were still using Siamese in their breeding programs. Registrations resumed in 1953 after the practice was stopped. Today the Burmese is a popular breed among cat lovers.",
    "personality": "Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Burmese are generally healthy, although they can be prone to gingivitis and may be sensitive to anesthesia. The following diseases have also been seen in Burmese:\n\nLipemia of the aqueous humor, a transient milky appearance of the eye during kittenhood, which usually resolves on its own.Corneal dermoid, the presence of skin and hair on the surface of the cornea, which can be successfully corrected surgically.Orofacial pain syndrome, indicated by exaggerated licking and chewing motions and pawing at the mouth. The discomfort can increase when the cat is excited or stressed, and the cats often are reluctant to eat because the activity is painful. Some cats must wear an Elizabethan collar and have their paws bandaged so they don\u2019t hurt themselves. Some cases resolve on their own, then recur.

Signs include general weakness, a stiff gait, reluctance to walk, and head tremors. It can be treated with potassium supplements given orally.Flat-chested kitten syndrome, a deformity that can range from mild to severe. Kittens who survive to adulthood usually show no signs once they reach maturity.Kinked tail, usually as a result of a deformity of the tailbone. It causes no pain or discomfort.Elbow osteoarthritis, an early onset of arthritis in the elbow, limiting the cat\u2019s activity or mobility.Endocardial fibroelastosis, a heart condition in which the left ventricle of the heart thickens, stretching the heart muscle. Signs usually develop when a kitten is 3 weeks to 4 months old, good reason to wait until 4 months to bring a kitten home.Dilated cardiomyopathy, an enlarged heart.Diabetes mellitus, an endocrine condition caused by a defect in insulin secretion or insulin action that results in high levels of sugar in the blood.\n\n\u00a0",

    "size": "The Burmese is energetic and friendly. He has the charm and determination of his Siamese ancestors, and enjoys conversation as much as that breed, but his voice is soft and sweet, belying his tendency to run the household with an iron paw sheathed in velvety fur. He is highly intelligent and seeks out human companionship, so he\u2019s not best suited to a home where he will be left alone much of the day. If no humans will be around to engage his intellect, be sure he has the company of another pet. He gets along well with other cats and with dogs, but of course another Burmese will be his best pal.\n\nThe Burmese is about as curious as cats come. Expect him to explore your home thoroughly and know all of its nooks and crannies. He is playful and remains so into adulthood. Tease his clever mind with interactive toys, and teach him tricks that will allow him to show off for an audience. Besides sit, roll over, wave and come, he can learn to fetch a small toy or walk on a leash. With proper early conditioning, car rides and vet visits will be a breeze.\n\nA Burmese is a good choice if you don\u2019t object to complete loss of privacy. This cat will want to be involved in everything you do, from reading the newspaper and working at the computer to preparing meals and watching television. He will, of course, sleep on the bed with you and may even snuggle under the covers. When you are sitting down, he will be in your lap or right next to you, waiting expectantly to be petted. You will be scolded if you ignore him. Guests will receive his full attention, and it is likely that he will win over even those who claim to dislike cats.\n\nA female Burmese is the very definition of queenliness. She likes attention and she likes to be in charge. Males are more restful, satisfied to fill a lap. Whichever you choose, it\u2019s likely that you will soon find yourself yearning for another.",

Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Trim the nails every couple of weeks. Wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge.

    "colorAndGrooming": "The Chartreux has the sturdy, powerful body of a working cat wrapped in a short, thick, water-repellent coat. Besides his beautiful fur, his most distinctive feature is his deep orange eyes, set in a rounded, broad head. He has full cheeks and a sweet, smiling expression. Medium-size ears sit high on the head.\n\nHis body type is sometimes described as primitive, being husky and robust with broad shoulders and a deep chest. His relatively short and fine-boned legs rest on round, medium-size paws that look almost dainty. A lively, flexible tail is heavy at the base, tapering to an oval tip.\n\nDon\u2019t let his ample body and solid muscle mass fool you. This is a supple, agile cat who typically weighs 7 to 16 pounds at maturity. Pick him up and you may be surprised by his heft. Chartreux grow slowly and males especially may not reach their full size until they are 4 or 5 years old.\n\nThe medium-short double coat has a slightly woolly texture, which varies depending on the cat\u2019s age and gender, as well as the climate in which he lives. For instance, mature males have the heaviest coats, while females or young cats may have a thinner coat or one that feels silky.\n\nThe coat can be any shade of blue-gray. The tips of the fur look as if they have been lightly brushed with silver. Kittens may have the faint imprint of tabby markings (called ghost barring) or tail rings, but by the time they mature the coat should have a bright, even tone. Completing the look is slate-gray nose leather, blue lips, and rose-taupe paw pads.",
    "health": "Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Chartreux are generally healthy, but the following problems have been seen in the breed.\n\nPatellar luxation is a hereditary dislocation of the kneecap that can range from mild to severe. Mild patellar luxation rarely causes problems. Severe cases cause lameness, but can be alleviated with surgery.\n\n\u00a0",
    "history": "With his cloak of gray fur, sober as a monk\u2019s robes,\u00a0 it\u2019s no wonder that the Chartreux was associated with the Carthusian order in France. The quiet mousers would have been perfect companions for members of the silent, solitary order. It\u2019s a pretty legend, but there is no real evidence that the cats were kept by the Carthusians, although perhaps they were simply not considered important enough to mention.\n\nA more likely scenario is that the cats, a natural breed, were commonly found in France at least as far back as the 18th century, performing rat patrol in stables, shops and homes. Unfortunately for the beautifully furred felines, they were also prized by furriers for their thick blue pelts. A type of luxurious wool called \u201cpile de Chartreux\u201d may have taken its name from the soft, woolly coated cats.\n\nAs with so many breeds, however, it\u2019s not really known how the cats came by their name or how or where they were developed. One of the earliest references to a French gray cat dates to 1558, an epitaph for Belaud, who belonged to poet Joachin de Bellay. Bellay describes Belaud \u201cdeath to rats,\u201d which is certainly an attribute of the breed, then and now.\n\nThe first reference to the name Chartreux for the blue cats is found in the Universal Dictionary of Commerce, Natural History and the Arts and Trade of Savvary of Brusion, published in 1723, which also mentions the cats\u2019 association with the fur trade. French naturalist George-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, described them as the cat of France and gave them the Latin name Felis catus coeruleus, meaning blue cat.\n\nFree-living groups of the cats lived in Paris and other areas of France until the early 1900s. They were not much valued, except for their skins and their aptitude for vermin control. It wasn\u2019t until after World War I that French cat lovers took steps to preserve the breed. They gathered as many cats as they could and wrote a breed standard. Using only the cats that met the standard and produced kittens that met it, they were able to begin exhibiting the cats in European shows in either 1928 or 1931, depending on the source. One of the breed\u2019s early adherents was the novelist Colette, whose Chartreux Saha took pride of place in her book La Chatte. General Charles de Gaulle was also known to love the breed, owning one named Gris Gris.\n\nIt was fortunate that fanciers had begun to breed the Chartreux when they did, because after World War II, none of the free-roaming cats could be found. Chartreux, which are still uncommon, were first imported into the United States in 1970 and were recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association in 1987. Today the cats are recognized by all major American cat associations. The Chartreux is even the official mascot of the Montreux Jazz Festival. They are less known in Europe, even in their homeland of France. Unlike many cat breeds, they have changed little over the years and remain, as Bellay wrote:\n\n\u201cthe most handsome perhaps\n\nThat nature ever made in cat\u2019s clothing.\u201d",
    "personality": "The Chartreux might well be compared to a mime, silent but communicative and sometimes silly. Short playtimes interspersed with naps and meals are his idea of the perfect day. When he is not displaying his superb timing and pouncing ability, \u201ckilling\u201d toys with abandon, or performing acrobatic flips as he chases a lure toy, he is an attentive and gentle companion who likes to stay near his people and observe their doings. He appreciates any attention he receives, especially if it involves scratching him beneath the chin or between the ears, but he\u2019s not demanding, content to follow you around devotedly, sleep on your bed and snuggle with you if you\u2019re not feeling well.\n\nHe rarely uses his voice, preferring to direct your actions with a glance from his pumpkin-colored eyes. If need be, however, he may communicate with a\u00a0 small meow or chirp. Make a habit of observing him carefully and being familiar with his actions since it is unlikely that he will vocalize any discomfort or make any sound to let you know where he is.\n\nThis is an adaptable cat with a middle-of-the-road personality. He\u2019s not a social butterfly, but he\u2019s not a shy wallflower, either. Expect him to watch and wait before deciding whether to greet a guest or otherwise involve himself in a situation. His calm nature makes him suited to staying home alone while you are out earning the money for his treats and toys, but he won\u2019t object to keeping company with another cat or dog. That same good nature makes him a good travel companion for an RV enthusiast or long-distance truck driver. As long as you keep his routine similar each day, he will be a happy camper.\n\nThe Chartreux has a sunny, polite disposition that makes him a pleasure to live with. This is one cat who\u00a0 does his best to obey the rules. Always treat him kindly and patiently, and you will be rewarded with a friend for life.",

    "history": "The Colorpoint Shorthair is a Siamese of a different color\u2014non-traditional colors, that is. \u00a0The breed was developed using Siamese as the foundation and then crossing it with a red American Shorthair to bring in a new color. That was successful and attractive, and the cats became the basis for a new breed: the Colorpoint Shorthair. \u00a0Eventually, other non-traditional colors were created. The breed was recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association in 1964. The International Cat Association considers the Colorpoint a variety of Siamese, not a separate breed.",
    "personality": "The Siamese and the Colorpoint Shorthair might differ in color, but beneath the skin they are identical. The Colorpoint Shorthair is talkative and opinionated. He will tell you exactly what he thinks, in a loud, raspy voice, and he expects you to pay attention and act on his advice. Colorpoints are extremely fond of their people. They like to be \u201chelpful\u201d and will follow you around and supervise your every move. When you are sitting down, a Colorpoint Shorthair will be in your lap, and at night he will be in bed with you, probably under the covers with his head on the pillow.\n\nDo not get a Colorpoint if living with a chatty busybody would drive you insane. On the other hand, if you enjoy having someone to talk to throughout the day, a Colorpoint can be your best friend. Just be sure you have time to spend with this demanding and social cat. Colorpoints do not like being left alone for long periods, and if you work during the day it can be smart to get two of them so they can keep each other company.\n\nThe Colorpoint is highly intelligent, agile and athletic, and loves to play. Keep his busy brain active with puzzle toys and his body exercised with teaser toys that he can chase and a big cat tree he can climb. He is fully capable of opening doors and drawers or rifling through your purse in search of something interesting or shiny to play with. Never leave him without any form of entertainment, or you will likely come home to find that he has reprogrammed your DVR to record only nature shows or at the very least decided that your toilet paper rolls and tissue boxes look better empty.\n\nChoose a Colorpoint if you look forward to spending time with and interacting with your cat. This is a loyal and loving feline who will pout and pine if given little or no attention. In the right home, however, he thrives for years.",

    "care": "Grooming the Cornish Rex is typically as easy as brushing your hand over his coat. Some Cornish Rex cats have a longer or woollier coat, however, and may need some help from a soft bristle brush or fine-tooth comb to keep their coat looking neat. Groom gently so you don\u2019t break the delicate hairs. The best thing about a Cornish Rex coat is that the hairs are so fine that they aren\u2019t very noticeable on clothing and furniture.\n\nBaths are rarely necessary unless the cat is white or has a lot of white on the coat. Those cats can start to look dingy if they are not regularly bathed.\n\nBrush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Wipe the corners of the eyes daily with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don\u2019t run the risk of spreading any infection. Check the ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear.\n\nKeep the litter box spotlessly clean. Like all cats, Cornish Rex are very particular about bathroom hygiene.\n\nThe Cornish Rex feels warm to the touch, but he is always seeking warmth. If you are cold, he probably is too. Buy him a nice sweater or two to help him retain heat.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to keep a Cornish Rex as an indoor-only cat to protect him from diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car. Cornish Rex who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such an unusual cat without paying for it. If possible, build your Cornish Rex a large outdoor enclosure where he can jump and climb safely. If your Cornish REx has an outdoor enclosure that allows for sunbathing, be sure to apply cat-safe sunscreen to his body to prevent sunburn.",

    "colorAndGrooming": "With his crushed velvet coat, racy, slender body, and curly whiskers, the Cornish Rex is a dandy of a cat. In addition to his soft, wavy fur and curvy body, he is distinguished by a small, egg-shaped head, about one-third longer than it is wide. His facial features include a rounded forehead, the high cheekbones of a supermodel, a Roman nose with a high, prominent bridge, and oval eyes that slant slightly upward. Sitting high on the head are large ears that look as if they could pull in satellite signals.\n\nThe distinctive body, a gift from the Cornish Rex\u2019s Siamese ancestors, is made up graceful arches and curves. It consists of a long, slender torso, a deep chest, a naturally arched back, and a belly that curves gently upward to form a small waistline. Muscular hips, thighs and rear end propel the Cornish Rex\u2019s great leaps. Supporting him when he lands are long, slender legs and dainty, slightly oval paws. A long, flexible tail tapers toward the end. His curvy, slender body might make the medium-size Cornish Rex seem delicate, but he is surprisingly heavy when picked up. He typically weighs 6 to 10 pounds.\n\nThe Cornish Rex curls are present at birth. Some kittens go through a stage during which the coat is flat and suedelike, but as they mature the coat becomes wavy again. At adulthood, usually between 18 months and three years, the coat is short, soft and silky, with no harsh guard hairs. The fur lies close to the body in tight waves, like the marcelled hairdo of a 1940s film star. It should not be sparse or bare in places.\n\nThe coat comes in a profusion of colors and patterns. Solid colors are white, black, blue, red, cream, chocolate and lavender. They also come in various tabby colors and patterns, tortoiseshell, calico, bi-color and pointed patterns, to name just a few. Depending on the coat color, the eyes may be gold, green or hazel.",
    "health": "Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Cornish Rex are generally healthy, but the following diseases have been seen in the breed:\n\nCongenital hypotrichosis, otherwise known as hereditary baldness, a condition that is probably the result of an inherited recessive gene. The Cornish Rex naturally has a very fine coat, but those with less hair than normal for the breed are considered to be hypotricotic.\n\nUmbilical hernia, which occurs when a defect in the abdominal wall\u2014near the umbilicus, hence the name\u2014allows part of the intestine or other abdominal organs to protrude through the abdominal wall. The last known report of umbilical hernias in the breed was from 1997. Umbilical hernias can also have non-genetic causes.\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a form of heart disease that is inherited in some cat breeds such as the Maine Coon. Heritability has not been proven in the Cornish Rex.",
    "history": "Cornwall is a sort of magical corner of Great Britain. It was the birthplace of King Arthur, and it was the birthplace of one of the most unusual and interesting cat breeds in existence: the curly-coated Cornish Rex. A curly-coated kitten was born in 1950 to a shorthaired tortoiseshell and white pet cat named Serena, who belonged to Nina Ennismore and Winifred Macalister. The other four kittens in the litter had short hair, so Kallibunker, as he was named, stood out for his odd coat, the result of a spontaneous natural mutation. As is so often the case, the father of the litter was unidentified, although he was suspected to be Ginger, a shorthaired red tabby who was Serena\u2019s litter brother.\n\nAfter obtaining advice on how to establish the new trait, Ennismore attempted to produce more of the kittens, breeding them to each other and outcrossing to shorthaired cats. She was somewhat successful, breeding among others a cat named Poldhu and his daughter LaMorna Cove, both of whom contributed to the later development of the breed, which came to be called the Cornish Rex, after its birthplace and its coat type, similar in texture to that of rex rabbits.\n\nLaMorna Cove had been exported to the United States, and her kittens\u2014from a breeding with Poldhu before she made her journey across the pond\u2014helped to establish the breed in the United States. Because of the lack of breeding stock, the cats in the U. S. were outcrossed to Siamese. A son of Poldhu, Sham Pain Chas, fathered a litter in Great Britain in 1960, keeping the breed alive in its homeland. Also contributing to its survival was the birth of two curly-coated kittens in East Germany, who were determined to have a similar mutation that was compatible with that of the Cornish Rex.\n\nThe American Cat Fanciers Association and the Canadian Cat Association recognized the Cornish Rex in 1963, followed by the Cat Fanciers Association in 1964. The breed is now recognized by all cat registries.",
    "personality": "The Cornish Rex appears suave and refined, but then this charming and highly intelligent cat\u2019s sense of humor and love of attention take over and he strolls onto center stage, ready to play the piano, perform tricks, or amaze onlookers with his ability to vault to the highest point in the room. His long toes enable him to manipulate objects deftly and to open doors and cabinets with ease. Be sure you put away securely anything you don\u2019t want him to have (and don\u2019t let him see you doing it).\n\nThis is a confident cat who loves people and will follow them around, waiting for any opportunity to sit in a lap or give a kiss. He enjoys being handled, making it easy to take him to the veterinarian or train him for therapy work.\n\nIf it weren\u2019t insulting, it might be fair to describe the Cornish Rex as \u201cdoglike.\u201d That includes his willingness to retrieve toys that are thrown. He has the speed of a sighthound but does not share the sighthound\u2019s laidback temperament. The Cornish Rex is highly active, always on the move. His speed and sleek exterior are reminiscent of a finely tuned racecar, complete with quick starts and cornering ability. Although he is affectionate and gentle, he is not the choice for someone who wants a quiet, ornamental cat. His voice ranges from sweet to strident, and although he is not as talkative as his ancestor the Siamese, he will indeed carry on a conversation if he feels the need to express his opinion.\n\nThe Cornish Rex maintains his kittenlike attitude well into old age. He never loses the desire to interact with people and is best suited to a home where he will receive the love and constant companionship he craves.",

An adult Cymric may not appreciate children as readily, especially if he is used to a quiet household. Always introduce pets slowly and in controlled circumstances to ensure that they learn to get along together.",
    "colorAndGrooming": "The Cymric is known for his lack of a tail, but not every Cymric is completely tailless. Some, known as \u201clongies,\u201d have a normal-length tail, and others, known as \u201cstumpies,\u201d have short tails. A Cymric with no tail is called a \u201crumpy\u201d and one with just a rise of bone at the end of the spine is known as a \u201criser.\u201d You will see only rumpies and risers in the show ring, but cats with tails can be used in Cymric breeding programs.\n\nA Cymric has other distinguishing characteristics as well, including a round head with large round eyes, a stout, powerful body with a broad chest, short back and broad, round rear end, short front legs and long hind legs with muscular thighs. The long rear legs give him the appearance of a rabbit and may be the source of the \u201ccabbit\u201d myth.\n\nThe Cymric has a long, soft, silky double coat that comes in many different colors, including various solids, tabbies, tortoiseshells and calicos. Chocolate and lavender colors and the pointed Himalayan pattern are not permitted. The coat gradually lengthens from the shoulders, and the fur on the neck ruff, upper rear legs (known as breeches) and belly is usually longer than that on the rest of the body. The neck ruff goes around the shoulders and forms what looks like a bib on the chest. Many Cymrics have tufts of furn on the toes and ears as well. Because of the long hair, especially over the rear, the Cymric sometimes looks longer than the Manx, but it\u2019s merely an optical illusion.\n\nThe Cymric matures slowly and may not reach his full size until he is five years old.",
    "health": "Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Cymric are generally healthy, but the following diseases have been seen in the breed:\n\n\u00a0\n\nArthritis of the tailbone in cats with partial tails\n\nCorneal dystrophy, cloudiness that begins to develop when a kitten is approximately 4 months old\n\nManx syndrome, a collection of birth defects that may include a spine that is too short, urinary tract defects, and problems with the bowels and digestion. The condition affects approximately 20 percent of Manx cats, most often rumpies, and usually shows up by the time a kitten is 4 months old, a good reason to wait until that age before bringing a Manx kitten home.",
    "history": "Is it really a cat if it doesn\u2019t have a tail? It is if it\u2019s a Cymric (pronounced kim-rick). There are lots of cats with short tails or no tails, but the Cymric (and his sister breed the shorthaired Manx) is the only one specifically bred to be tail-free. Sometimes jokingly said to be the offspring of a cat and a rabbit (however cute the idea, a \u201ccabbit\u201d is biologically impossible), these particular tailless cats are the result of a natural genetic mutation that was then intensified by their remote location on the Isle of Man, off the coast of Britain.\n\nThe cats are thought to date to 1750 or later, but whether a tailless cat was born there or arrived on a ship and then spread its genes throughout the island cat population is unknown. The island became known for tailless cats, and that is how the breed got its name of Manx. The Manx has long been recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association, The International Cat Association, and other cat registries. A longhaired version was accepted by CFA as a division of the Manx in 1994. In some associations, the longhaired Manx is called a Cymric and is considered a separate breed.",
    "personality": "These cats originated as mousers, and whether shorthaired or longhaired they retain their fine hunting skills and alert nature. With a Cymric around the house, you don\u2019t need a watchdog; you\u2019ve got a \u201cwatchcat\u201d who reacts rapidly and will growl threateningly or maybe even go on the attack at the sight or sound of anything out of the ordinary. If he sees that you aren\u2019t alarmed, he\u2019ll settle back down.\n\nWhen he\u2019s not protecting his family and property from mice, stray dogs, or other threats, however, the Cymric is a mellow fellow: an even-tempered and affectionate cat who enjoys serene surroundings. That\u2019s not to say he is inactive. This is a happy, playful cat who likes to follow his favorite person through the house and assist with whatever he or she is doing. When you are ready to relax, though, the Cymric will be in your lap, ready for a comfy nap. If no lap is available, he\u2019ll curl up on the nearest available spot that allows him to keep an eye on you. He \u201cspeaks\u201d in a quiet trill and will carry on a conversation if you talk to him.\n\nThe Cymric has an adaptable nature if he is exposed to activity and plenty of people as a young kitten. He will enjoy meeting new people, greeting them with a gentle head butt or cheek rub, and can adapt to a new home or family if such an upheaval in his life is necessary.\n\nThis is a smart cat who can learn tricks, including fetch and come, and is willing to walk on leash if taught early. He often likes to ride in the car, making him a great companion on long-distance trips. He is also good at learning how to open doors, so be sure anything you don\u2019t want him to have is under lock and key. Unlike most cats, the Cymric is willing to accept boundaries and will usually respect your wishes if you tell him no when he jumps on the counter or scratches on your sofa. Just be sure you give him an acceptable alternative as thanks for his nice behavior.\n\nThe Cymric is highly people-oriented. Choose him only if you can give him plenty of time and attention daily.",

Supervise interactions between young children and cats.\n\nWhen it comes to other household pets, the Desert Lynx can get along with many other domestic animals; although, you should exercise caution if you already have smaller pets. Always make sure to supervise playtime between the new cat and existing pets. Sometimes these relationships are very much dependent on the individual pets' personalities.\n\nUltimately, early socialization really pays off with this mixed breed. Make sure to reward your Desert Lynx for good behavior when you bring them home to your family!",
    "colorAndGrooming": "The Desert Lynx is usually found sporting a coat whose pattern is either spotted, ticked, or clouded. Common color combinations for the cat include chocolate brown, silver, ebony, and blue.\n\nWhen it comes to grooming a Desert Lynx, brushing the cat once or twice a week should suffice. This will help keep the feline's coat in good condition and also ward off the chances of mats forming. Use the grooming time as an opportunity to bond with your kitty pal.\n\nIn terms of climate, most Desert Lynx cats are fairly adaptable. Just remember to always make sure that there's enough shade and fresh water available during the hotter months.",
    "health": "The Desert Lynx is generally considered to be a healthy cat; although, it's always important to schedule regular wellness visits with your cat's vet.\n\nThere aren't any breed specific health problems associated with the Desert Lynx, but always keep an eye out for signs that your cat might be in distress or pain.",
    "history": "According to most accounts of the Desert Lynx's history, the origin of this fine feline possibly goes directly back to the bobcat. In a bid to breed a cat that combined the dashing wildcat look of the bobcat with tamer, more domestic sensibilities, a number of other feline breeds were mixed to create the Desert Lynx.\n\nThe Desert Lynx is recognized by The International Progressive Cat Breeders Alliance (IPCBA) for official registration.\n\nThese days, you may find the Desert Lynx in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. So make sure to consider adoption if you decide that this is the mixed breed for you!",
    "personality": "If you've been considering adopting a Desert Lynx, you might be wondering exactly what sort of cat you're going to be living with. First of all, despite the feline's action-packed name, the Desert Lynx is considered to be a totally domesticated cat.\n\nIn fact, the mixed breed has picked up a reputation for being more like a dog than a cat at times! So expect your Desert Lynx to act like a faithful companion who will like to follow you around and be by your side, whether you're relaxing on the couch with a good book or pottering around the kitchen preparing dinner.\n\nThis is a very social cat who forms long-lasting bonds with the loving humans in their life. The Desert Lynx has a strong playful side, so you'll need to be able to commit to regular play sessions and also provide a living environment that gives the cat the option to roam around and explore.",

    "care": "The Devon\u2019s wavy coat is easy to maintain. Groom gently so you don\u2019t break the delicate hairs. In many cases, brushing your hand over the coat is all it needs. The best thing about a Devon Rex coat is that it doesn\u2019t shed much, and the fur is so fine that it isn\u2019t very noticeable on clothing and furniture.\n\nBaths are rarely necessary unless the cat is white or has a lot of white on the coat. Those cats can start to look dingy if they are not regularly bathed. The coat dries quickly after a bath.\n\nBrush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Wipe the corners of the eyes daily with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don\u2019t run the risk of spreading any infection. Check the ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear.\n\nKeep the litter box spotlessly clean. Like all cats, Devon Rex are very particular about bathroom hygiene.\n\nThe Devon Rex feels warm to the touch, but he is always seeking warmth. If you are cold, he probably is too. Buy him a nice sweater or two to help him retain heat.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to keep a Devon Rex as an indoor-only cat to protect him from diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car. Devon Rex who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such an unusual cat without paying for it. If possible, build your Devon Rex a large outdoor enclosure where he can jump and climb safely. If your Devon Rex has an outdoor enclosure that allows for sunbathing, be sure to apply cat-safe sunscreen to his body to prevent sunburn.",

    "colorAndGrooming": "The Devon is often described as having an elfin appearance, with his large ears, high cheekbones and striking eyes. His outstanding characteristic, however, is his soft, wavy fur. His curvy body starts with his head, a modified wedge shape with convex curves forming the outer edge of the ear lobes, the cheekbones and the whisker pads. The Devon has large, wide-set, oval-shaped eyes and strikingly large ears set low on the head. Sometimes the tips of the ears are tufted with fine fur.\n\nA \u201crexed\u201d coat is soft and fine, appearing to be without the harsh guard hairs that characterize most cat coats. The cat\u2019s body is well covered with fur, most thickly on the back, sides, tail, legs, face and ears. Some Devons have loose, shaggy curls, while others have a coat that is more thin and suedelike. The hair on the top of the head, the neck, chest and abdomen is slightly less dense and may even look downy, but the cat should never have bare patches. Smooth the coat with your hand and rippled waves appear. It comes in any genetically possible color, pattern or combination of colors and patterns, including solid white, black, blue, chocolate, cinnamon, lavender and red;\u00a0 smoke patterns, which are a white undercoat deeply tipped with a specific color; and various calico, tabby, tortoiseshell and pointed patterns.\n\nA Devon\u2019s medium-size body is deceptively slender, unless the cat has been sneaking too many snacks. His body should feel hard and muscular. The legs are long and slim, supported by small, oval paws. A long, fine tail covered with short fur tapers at the end.",
    "health": "Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Devon Rex are generally healthy, but the following diseases have been seen in the breed:\n\n\u00a0\n\nCongenital hypotrichosis, otherwise known as hereditary baldness, a condition that is probably the result of an inherited recessive gene. The Devon Rex naturally has a very fine coat, but those with less hair than normal for the breed are considered to be hypotricotic.\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a form of heart disease that is inherited in some cat breeds such as the Maine Coon. Heritability has not been proven in the Devon Rex.\n\nMalassezia dermatitis, a single-celled yeast that causes ear infections, greasy skin and itchiness, which is treated with antifungal drugs.\n\nHip dysplasia, a malformation of the hip socket that causes laxity of the hip joint.\n\nUrticaria pigmentosa, a dermatological problem that causes crusty sores on the body and is treated with prednisolone and essential fatty acids.\n\nDevon Rex myopathy, also known as spasticity, is an inherited condition that becomes apparent between 3 weeks and 6 months of age. It causes generalized muscle weakness, and the cats tire easily. No treatment is available, and severity of the condition varies. It may remain stable or progress slowly.",
    "history": "It was first thought that Kirlee, a kitten born in Devon, England, in 1959, shared the same genetic makeup as the Cornish Rex, a breed born a decade earlier in nearby Cornwall, but test breedings soon established that Kirlee was unique, another result of a natural genetic mutation. As suggested by his name, Kirlee had a wavy coat. Little is known of his ancestry. His mother was a stray, and his father was thought to be a roaming tom who also had a curly coat.\n\nKirlee became the progenitor of a new breed, the Devon Rex, named for his birthplace of Devonshire, as well as his curly coat, which had a texture reminiscent of that of a rex rabbit. Less than a decade later, in 1968, a Devon Rex had emigrated to the United States. The Cat Fanciers Association gave the breed full recognition in 1979.",
    "personality": "The Devon\u2019s favorite perch is right at head level, on the shoulder of his favorite person. He takes a lively interest in everything that is going on and refuses to be left out of any activity. Count on him to stay as close to you as possible, occasionally communicating his opinions in a quiet voice. He loves people and welcomes the attentions of friends and family alike.\n\nThis is a smart cat with a moderate activity level. He\u2019s not in constant motion, but he does like to learn tricks and play fetch. Puzzle toys and interactive toys are a delight to his inventive brain and will help to keep him occupied while you are out earning money to buy more of them.\n\nAt mealtime, the Devon will try to seat himself at the dining room table with the rest of the family, sure that the food you have prepared is just for him. He likes to eat and will snack himself into a few extra pounds if you don\u2019t carefully monitor his food intake.\n\nUnder the covers is his preferred place to sleep. Like a heat-seeking missile, he targets the warmest spots he can find.\n\nChoose a Devon if you will enjoy the company of a mischievous, agile cat and won\u2019t be alarmed to see him peering down at you from the top of a door, plotting the trajectory to your shoulder.",

    "colorAndGrooming": "The Donskoy's coat comes in four different types that can be many different colors. These coats are known as rubber bald, flocked, velour, and brush. Rubber bald cats are bald and remain that way for life. Flocked coats are yellowish and may disappear as the baldness gene takes over. Velour kittens have a bald spot on their heads with wiry, woolly hair on the body that disappears after their first year, though some of the coat can remain. Brush coats cover the whole body except for patches on the head and neck or back.\n\nWhen it comes to grooming, the Donskoy is a hairless cat so you'll need to wipe the breed down daily. This is to get rid of oils that the skin produces--as a hairless cat, there is no hair to absorb the oils. You'll also need to instigate a bathing routine, ideally once a week but definitely at least twice a month.\n\nClimate is also an issue to keep an eye on: The Donskoy does not fair well in extreme temperatures. Speak to your vet about applying a suitable sunscreen to the cat, and also consider a cat coat during the colder months. While Donskoys may grow a winter coat, it is often fine and not suited for very cold winters.\n\nInterestingly, cats of this breed can sweat through their skin and even get tan with exposure to sunlight, much like humans.

    "history": "The story of the Donskoy begins in 1987 in Russia when a professor named Elena Kovaleva noticed some kids playing soccer with a bag. When Kovaleva heard the sound of meowing coming from inside the bag, she discovered that a kitten was being kicked around.\n\nAfter Kovaleva rescued the kitten, she noticed that the animal began to lose their hair as they grew older. Later on, the cat gave birth to more kittens who also lost their hair or were born bald! One of these kittens was adopted by a breeder named Irina Nemikina, who began to develop the Donskoy.\n\nThe Donskoy was officially recognized by the International Cat Association (TICA) in 1987.\n\nThese days, you may find Donskoys in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. So make sure to consider adoption if you decide that this is the breed for you!",

It's vital to understand that the breed needs companionship, so this is not the best cat to adopt if you're away for long periods of the day due to work commitments or if you travel a lot.\n\nThe Donskoy is an intelligent and inquisitive cat, so you'll also want to provide an environment where the breed can explore and seek out new adventures on their own.

    "history": "Whether the Mau is a product of thousands of years of Egyptian culture is a matter of debate, but if fanciers of the strikingly spotted cats wish to claim that they date to the times of the pharaohs, well, who knows? It could be true.\n\nThe Egyptian Mau (mau being the Egyptian word for cat) is notable for being the only naturally spotted domesticated cat. In other words, the spotting pattern was not created by human manipulation of feline genes. The cats were known in Europe before World War II, but the devastation of the war left the breed in a perilous state.\n\nThe breed as it is known today dates to a silver female kitten given to Russian princess Natalie Troubetskoy when she was living in Rome. Depending on the story, the kitten was given to her by a young boy who had been keeping it in a shoebox or she acquired one from the Egyptian ambassador to Italy. Troubetskoy named the kitten Baba. When she moved to the United States in 1956, Baba and two of her offspring came with her. Troubetskoy wanted to ensure that the Mau survived as a breed, so she wrote a breed standard and began breeding the cats under the cattery name Fatima.\n\nThe breed was recognized in 1968 by the Cat Fanciers Federation, followed in 1977 by the Cat Fanciers\u2019 Association. Importation of more Maus in the 1980s and again in 1991 increased the breed\u2019s gene pool. Today the breed is recognized by most cat associations.",
    "personality": "When the Egyptian Mau is happy, you know it. He vocalizes (called chortling) in a quiet, pleasant voice, swishes his tail rapidly, and kneads with his front paws. What makes him happy is being with his family, to whom he is fiercely devoted, or showing off his hunting prowess by chasing and retrieving a tossed toy or stalking and pouncing on a wriggling lure at the end of a fishing pole toy.\n\nThis is a moderately to highly active cat. He likes to jump and climb and will appreciate a tall cat tree, a window perch or two, and a sturdy scratching post that allows him to stretch out to full height. The Mau also enjoys playing in water. Don\u2019t be surprised to find him dipping a paw into your koi pond or aquarium, turning on the tap in the bathroom or kitchen, or splashing water out of your pool \u2014 or his water dish.\n\nThe Egyptian Mau prefers family members to anyone else. When he\u2019s not playing fetch, he enjoys sitting\u00a0 in a lap and being worshipped, just as his ancestors may have been.\n\nThe Mau\u00a0has the distinction of being the fastest domestic housecat, as she can run at speeds of up to 30 mph.",

He is more gently rounded with a body that is less compact but never long and slinky like that of the Siamese. The top of the head is slightly rounded with plenty of space between the ears and wide cheekbones that taper to a short, blunt wedge. The eyes, which range in color from yellow to amber, slant more toward the nose and have a less rounded opening than the eyes of the Burmese. Medium-size ears are slightly rounded at the tips and tilt slightly forward. Slender legs are supported by small, oval paws. A medium-length tail tapers slightly to a rounded tip.\n\nLike the Burmese, the European Burmese is heavier than he looks and can also lay claim to the description \u201ca brick wrapped in silk.\u201d He wears a short and satiny coat that comes in 10 different colors: brown, blue, chocolate, lilac, red, cream, and brown, blue, chocolate, and lilac tortoiseshell.

European Burmese are generally healthy, although they can be prone to gingivitis and may be sensitive to anesthesia. The following diseases have also been seen in European Burmese:\n\n\u00a0\n\nLipemia of the aqueous humor, a transient milky appearance of the eye during kittenhood, which usually resolves on its own.\n\nCorneal dermoid, the presence of skin and hair on the surface of the cornea, which can be successfully corrected surgically.\n\nGangliosidosis, an enzyme deficiency. A test has been developed that will allow the disease to be detected.\n\nOrofacial pain syndrome, indicated by exaggerated licking and chewing motions and pawing at the mouth. The discomfort can increase when the cat is excited or stressed, and the cats often are reluctant to eat because the activity is painful. Some cats must wear an Elizabethan collar and have their paws bandaged so they don\u2019t hurt themselves. Some cases resolve on their own, then recur. The cause and the mode of inheritance are unknown. Pain medications and anti-seizure drugs can help, as can consultation with a veterinary dentist to rule out dental disease.\n\nCongenital peripheral vestibular disease, causing head tilting, poor balance, rapid eye movements and uncoordinated walking in kittens. Some kittens with the condition may also be deaf.\n\nHypokalemic polymyopathy, muscle weakness caused by low levels of potassium in the blood, which is sometimes seen in Burmese kittens. Signs include general weakness, a stiff gait, reluctance to walk, and head tremors. It can be treated with potassium supplements given orally.\n\nFlat-chested kitten syndrome, a deformity that can range from mild to severe.

    "history": "The ancestors of the Burmese are the Siamese and the \u201ccopper cat\u201d of Burma (now known as Myanmar). It\u2019s thought that they were temple and palace cats bred and kept by priests. The matriarch of the modern Burmese was a small, dark-brown cat named Wong Mau. She belonged to Dr. Joseph Thompson, who either acquired her from a sailor or brought her back himself from his travels, depending on which story you believe.\n\nWong Mau was at first thought to be a Siamese with a chocolate-colored coat. Such Siamese weren\u2019t unheard of. \u201cChocolate Siamese\u201d were described in the 1880s. Their bodies were tan or brown, and they had seal-brown or nearly black points. The seal-point Siamese, also known as royal Siamese, had lighter bodies that contrasted with their dark points and were preferred by breeders and the public. The chocolate-colored cats eventually disappeared in Britain, but they still existed in Thailand and Burma, where they were probably the offspring of natural (as opposed to human-directed) matings between free-roaming Siamese (pointed) and solid-colored Burmese cats. Wong Mau was one of them. It was her destiny to become the matriarch of two new breeds: the Burmese and, later, the Tonkinese.\n\nDr. Thompson bred Wong Mau to a seal-point Siamese named Tai Mau. His breeding program, in conjunction with breeders Virginia Cobb and Billie Gerst and geneticist Clyde Keeler, produced kittens with beige, brown and pointed coats. The results, including the discovery of the Burmese gene, were so interesting that Thompson published an article on the subject in the Journal of Heredity, the first such piece on feline genetics. The brown cats were chosen to develop as a new breed: the Burmese.\n\nThe Cat Fanciers Association began registering Burmese in 1936 but suspended registrations in 1947 because breeders were still using Siamese in their breeding programs. Registrations resumed in 1953 after the practice was stopped.\n\nIn Europe, however, the development of the Burmese took a different path. In Great Britain, where there was an even greater lack of breeding stock than in the United States, redpoint Siamese and British Shorthairs were used in breeding programs, and their genetic contribution included additional colors: red, cream, brown-tortie, chocolate-tortie, blue-tortie and lilac-tortie. They eventually became known as Foreign Burmese, or European Burmese.",
    "personality": "When it comes to personality, the European Burmese and the Burmese are in alignment. The European Burmese is energetic and friendly. He has the charm and determination of his Siamese ancestors, and enjoys conversation as much as that breed, but his voice is soft and sweet, belying his tendency to run the household with an iron paw sheathed in velvety fur. He is highly intelligent and seeks out human companionship, so he\u2019s not best suited to a home where he will be left alone much of the day. If no humans will be around to engage his intellect, be sure he has the company of another pet. He gets along well with other cats and with dogs, but of course another Burmese (of either type) will be his best pal.\n\nThe European Burmese is about as curious as cats come. Expect him to explore your home thoroughly and know all of its nooks and crannies. He is playful and remains so into adulthood. Tease his clever mind with interactive toys, and teach him tricks that will allow him to show off for an audience. Besides sit, roll over, wave and come, he can learn to fetch a small toy or walk on a leash. With proper early conditioning, car rides and vet visits will be a breeze.\n\nA European Burmese is a good choice if you don\u2019t object to complete loss of privacy. This cat will want to be involved in everything you do, from reading the newspaper and working at the computer to preparing meals and watching television. He will, of course, sleep on the bed with you and may even snuggle under the covers. When you are sitting down, he will be in your lap or right next to you, waiting expectantly to be petted. You will be scolded if you ignore him. Guests will receive his full attention, and it is likely that he will win over even those who claim to dislike cats.\n\nA female European Burmese is the very definition of queenliness. She likes attention and she likes to be in charge. Males are more restful, satisfied to fill a lap. Whichever you choose, it\u2019s likely that you will soon find yourself yearning for another.",

The head is supported by a short, thick neck and a deceptively sturdy, muscular body\u2014a type known as \u201ccobby.\u201d An Exotic\u2019s legs are short, thick and strong with large, round, firm paws. The tail is short but proportional to the length of the cat\u2019s body.\n\nA medium-length soft, thick, plush coat with a rich, thick undercoat completes the Exotic\u2019s look.

Cats with the traditional look \u00a0have a more old-fashioned appearance, with a face that is not as flat and a nose that is set lower on the face with more of a \u201cbreak,\u201d permitting easier breathing.

    "history": "\u00a0\n\nIf the Persian is a cat in a glamourous evening gown, the Exotic is the Persian stripped down to its skivvies. The Exotic Shorthair, or Exotic for short, is a Persian of a different coat. The new breed first began to be developed in the 1950s by crossing Persians with American Shorthairs and, later, other shorthaired breeds such as the Burmese and the Russian Blue, then breeding back to Persians once the short coat was achieved. The eventual result was a cat with the same features and personality as the Persian but wrapped in a short, plush, easy-care coat.\n\nThe cross, which had originally been intended to bring the Persian\u2019s striking silver color and green eyes to the American Shorthair, was controversial at first, but Persian breeders became intrigued by the new look and began to cooperate in the development of what became known as the Exotic.\n\nThe Cat Fanciers Association recognized the breed in 1967 and called it the Exotic. In some other associations, it\u2019s known as the Exotic Shorthair to differentiate it from the Exotic Longhairs that sometimes appear in Exotic litters and are considered by some associations as a breed unto themselves. The International Cat Association recognized the breed as the Exotic Shorthair in 1979. Today Exotics are recognized by all cat registries. Exotics these days are outcrossed only to Persians and Himalayans, not to any shorthaired breeds.",

Exotics have a reputation for being more active and curious than their Persian siblings, and they are more suited to an active family. Males are said by some to be sweeter and more affectionate than females, who are sometimes described as aloof.\n\nExotics enjoy batting at toys for as long as you will play with them but are capable of entertaining themselves when their people are busy or away. They follow faithfully after family members and wait patiently for any attention to come their way. Exotics are little heard, but when they do speak it is in a soft, pleasant and musical voice. An Exotic\u2019s needs are simple: regular meals, a little playtime with a catnip mouse or feather teaser, and lots of love, which is returned many times over.",

    "history": "How did a brown cat of Southeast Asian origin, believed to offer protection from evil, come to be known as a Swiss Mountain Cat, and how did it then adopt the name Havana Brown? The full answers to those questions are lost to history, but what appears to have happened is that solid-brown cats of Siamese type from Thailand were exhibited in Britain in the 1890s. Somehow during that time they acquired the moniker Swiss Mountain Cat.\n\nIn 1920, the Siamese Cat Club of Britain decided that brown cats without blue eyes were no longer desirable, and that was that. Breeders lost interest in them until the 1950s, when a group of British cat breeders set themselves the task of determining the genetic makeup of a self-brown (solid-colored) cat. They eventually produced a male chestnut-brown kitten, the result of a cross between a shorthaiared black cat and a chocolate-point Siamese.\n\nRussian Blues and Burmese may also have played a role in the development of what came to be known as the Havana Brown (whose only connection to Cuba is the supposed resemblance of his color to that of a fine Havana cigar). But as it turned out, according to an article in the 1982 CFA Yearbook, the most successful and most often used breeding to produce a self-brown cat was between a black shorthair and a seal-point Siamese carrying the chocolate gene.\n\nThe cats, which also went by the name Chestnut Foreign Shorthair\u2014as many aliases as they had, they might well have been Cold War Cuban spies\u2014were first exported to the United States in the 1950s. It was then that the breed began to go two different ways. In Britain he is now considered to be a brown Oriental Shorthair. In the U.S., he is known as the Havana Brown and has a body and head type that distinguishes him from his British cousin. The Cat Fanciers Association recognized the breed in 1964.\n\nThe Havana Brown is a rare breed, so much so that his genetic diversity is threatened. It has been propped up by an outcrossing program begun in 1998, which permits the cats to be bred to unregistered black or blue domestic shorthairs or certain colors of Oriental Shorthairs or chocolate-point or seal-point Siamese. The kittens produced by those breedings can then be bred to Havana Browns. If those kittens have the Havana Brown coloring, they can be registered as Havana Browns.",

    "history": "\u00a0\n\nThe Himalayan, or Himmie for short, is a Persian in Siamese drag. Unlike its parent breeds the Persian and the Siamese, which are considered natural breeds, meaning they weren\u2019t created through human intervention, the Himalayan is a man-made breed developed by crossing Persians with Siamese to bring in the color points and blue eyes of the Siamese. Breeders began to work toward this goal in 1931, at first simply to determine how the colorpoint gene was passed on. Through selective breeding over a period of years, cat breeder Virginia Cobb and Harvard Medical School researcher Clyde Keeler developed longhaired cats with the distinctive colorpoints of the Siamese. The first kitten to be called a Himalayan was named Newton\u2019s Debutante.\n\nIn the 1950s, British and North American breeders became interested in achieving a Siamese-pointed Persian. Starting with the Cobb-Keeler \u201crecipe\u201d to get the colorpoint pattern, they then bred the cats back to Persians to establish breed type. Once the cats bred true, recognition as a breed was sought.\n\nWhether he is considered a variety of Persian or a distinct breed depends on which cat association you talk to. The Cat Fanciers Association recognized the Himalayan as a distinct breed in 1957, but in 1984 the CFA Board of Directors decided to reclassify the Himalayan as a color variety of the Persian. The American Cat Association also considers the Himalayan a color variety of the Persian, and The International Cat Association recognizes the Himmie as a member of its \u201cPersian Group,\u201d which includes the Persian and the Exotic Shorthair. In other registries, including the American Association of Cat Enthusiasts, the American Cat Fanciers Association, and the Traditional Cat Association, the Himalayan is classified separately from the Persian.\n\nHimalayans may be outcrossed to Persians or, in some associations, Exotic Shorthairs, but the Siamese is no longer a part of the Himalayan breeding program. And today, no matter what he\u2019s called, the Himmie is among the most popular of pedigreed cats.",
    "personality": "\u00a0\n\nLike the Persian, the Himalayan is sweet, docile and quiet. She is an ornament to any home where she can enjoy sitting in a lap\u2014surely her rightful place\u2014being petted by those who are discerning enough to recognize her superior qualities, and playing house with kind children who will gently comb her hair, wheel her around in a baby buggy (but not dress her up), let her chase an interactive toy, then serve her tea at their parties. Himalayans are affectionate but discriminating.\n\nThey reserve their attention for family members and those few guests whom they feel they can trust. Loud environments aren\u2019t a Himalayan\u2019s style; they are sedate cats who prefer a serene home where little changes from day to day. With large, expressive eyes and a voice that has been described as soft, pleasant and musical, Himmies let their simple needs be known: regular meals, a little playtime with a catnip mouse or feather teaser, and lots of love, which they return tenfold. This is one cat who is unlikely to climb up your curtains, jump on your kitchen counters, or perch on top of your refrigerator. She is perfectly happy to rule her domain from the floor or more accessible pieces of furniture.

At first, the Cat Fanciers Association categorized the Javanese as a distinct breed, separated from the Balinese by color, but in 2008 the Javanese was declared a division of the Balinese breed. The International Cat Association also considers the Javanese a variety of Balinese and places both in its Siamese grouping of breeds. The Javanese may be outcrossed to the Balinese, Siamese, Colorpoint Shorthair and Oriental Longhair.",
    "personality": "The Siamese and the Javanese might differ in coat length and color, but beneath the skin they are identical. Javanese are extremely fond of their people. They like to be \u201chelpful\u201d and will follow you around and supervise your every move. When you are sitting down, a Javanese will be in your lap, and at night he will be in bed with you, probably under the covers with his head on the pillow. He is frequently underfoot, so he might not be the best choice for people who are unsteady on their feet or use a walker or cane.\n\nA Javanese is perhaps not quite as loud as his relative the Siamese, but he is most definitely just as\u00a0 opinionated. He will tell you exactly what he thinks, and he expects you to pay attention and act on his advice. You can also count on him to \u201ctell all\u201d to visitors, so be grateful that most people are not conversant in the Javanese language.\n\nThe Javanese is highly intelligent, agile and athletic, and loves to play. Keep his busy brain active with puzzle toys and his body exercised with teaser toys that he can chase and a big cat tree he can climb. He likes to play fetch, is willing to walk on a leash, and learns tricks easily. He is also a good trainer himself and may be running your household before you know it. Never leave him without any form of entertainment, or you will likely come home to find that he has reprogrammed your DVR to record only nature shows or at the very least decided that your toilet paper rolls and tissue boxes look better empty.\n\nDo not get a Javanese if living with a chatty busybody would drive you insane. On the other hand, if you enjoy having someone to talk to throughout the day, the Javanese can be your best friend. Just be sure you have time to spend with this demanding and social cat. Javanese don\u2019t mind staying home during the day while you go off to earn money to buy cat food, but they will expect you to devote time to them when you are at home. It can be smart to get two of them so they can keep each other company.\n\nChoose a Javanese if you look forward to spending time with and interacting with your cat. This is a loyal and loving feline who will pout and pine if given little or no attention. In the right home, however, he thrives for years.",

They can get along with other cats, and with dogs, but they expect to have pride of place. This may or may not go over well with other animals. The Korat likes to have company, however, and if he spends a lot of time with another cat or dog, they will likely become close friends.",

As he matures, the eyes turn to amber, the pupil surrounded by a fringe of green. By the time the cat is two to four years old, the eyes have become the brilliant green for which the breed is known.\n\nThe short single coat has hairs that are a light blue at the roots, then deepen, ending in a silver tip, producing a halo effect. Unlike some breeds, the coat has its silver-blue color from the time kittens are born, although kittens may have what are known as \u201cghost tabby\u201d markings. These should disappear with maturity. The Korat\u2019s nose leather, lips and paw pads range from dark blue to lavender.",
    "health": "Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Korats are generally healthy, but they have a couple of issues buyers should be aware of: a genetic neuromuscular degenerative disease as well as low body fat, which can make them sensitive to anesthesia.\n\nGM1 and GM2 gangliosidosis occur when cats lack particular enzymes that are necessary for proper functioning of the nervous system. Fortunately, tests are available to identify cats that carry the diseases, so the condition is uncommon.\n\nKorats typically have a low percentage of body fat, so veterinarians should take this into account when determining how much and what type of anesthesia to given when a Korat is undergoing any type of surgery.\n\nBe sure to ask a breeder about the incidence of health problems in her lines and what testing has been done for any that are genetic in nature. In the case of GM1 or GM2, both parents should have been tested, and if one is positive or a carrier, the kittens should be tested as well.",
    "history": "Move over, rabbit\u2019s foot. The Korat is a living good-luck charm in his home country of Thailand, where he is also known as the Si-Sawat cat. The silver-blue cats with the emerald-green eyes are said to date to the 14th century based on their depiction in ancient literature. They were popular gifts, always presented in pairs, and had special meaning when given to brides because of their association with prosperity and fertility. The name Korat comes from the region in northeast Thailand where the cats are thought to have originated.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when Korats first came to the West. A cat that resembled a Korat was exhibited at a show in England in 1896, but whether it was truly a Korat (pronounced ko-raht) or simply a self-blue Siamese\u2014meaning solid-colored\u2014is not known.\n\nThe first known Korats imported into the United States arrived in 1959. Appropriately, they had been given as gifts to an American couple who were returning to the U.S. after the husband had retired from the Foreign Service. The Cat Fanciers Association recognized the breed in 1967, two years after Korat breeders founded the Korat Cat Fanciers Association to promote the breed.\n\nWherever they are found, all Korats can climb their family tree all the way back to Thailand. They are a natural breed and have never been outcrossed to any other breed as part of their development or to create another breed. They are recognized by all the major cat associations.",
    "personality": "The smart and opinionated Korat is possessive of his people. He likes to stay close by and won\u2019t desert them for visitors. He gives his heart to one or two people whose company he prefers, or with whom he spends the most time, but he\u2019s certainly willing to accept affection from others as well.\n\nBe aware of this propensity before you get a Korat, just in case having a cat follow you around all the time would drive you crazy. A Korat is not a loner. He does best with companionship, whether that is someone who works at home or another animal. There\u2019s a reason, it seems, that traditionally they were always given in pairs. A Korat who is frequently left alone or ignored may develop behavior problems such as aggression or separation anxiety.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that adult Korats can\u2019t switch their affections. Cats placed in new homes quickly adapt and bond closely with their new family.\n\nThis is an energetic cat who enjoys learning tricks, playing fetch and even walking on leash. It\u2019s easy to teach household rules to the Korat if you reward him with petting, a happy \u201cGood cat\u201d or a treat. Limit corrections to a loud \u201cNo!\u201d or hand clap.\n\nIf you have multiple cats, be sure you have plenty of toys to go around. The Korat did not learn to share in kittygarten, and he can be stubborn about giving up toys or other objects that he views as his.\n\nAlthough he can be bold with definite likes and dislikes, the Korat is generally a quiet cat who likes a quiet environment. Although he\u2019s not known for being talkative, he is capable of making many different sounds, from a chirp to a scream, when he wants to get his point across.\n\nChoose the Korat if you enjoy having a lap cat. He will be pleased to fulfill this desire any time you like.",

Tabbies, tortoiseshells and red cats are most common.\n\nLonghaired LaPerms have a plumed tail. The coat\u2019s length and fullness may vary seasonally. It sometimes parts naturally down the middle of the back.\n\nThe shorthaired LaPerm does not necessarily have a ruff, ringlets or \u201cearmuffs,\u201d and the texture of the coat may be harder than that of the longhaired LaPerm. He has a tail with fur that looks wavy, more like a bottlebrush than a plume. The short coat may also part down the middle of the back.\n\nWhatever the length, the LaPerm coat manifests in different ways. Kittens may be born hairless, with straight hair or with curly hair. Both longhaired and shorthaired kittens can be born in the same litter. You may notice that the name on your kitten\u2019s pedigree includes the letters BC, BS or BB. Those initials indicate whether the kitten was born curly, born straight or born bald and helps breeders study how the gene is expressed.\n\nThe LaPerm\u2019s head is a modified wedge shape, meaning it is slightly rounded. The medium-size to large ears are slightly flared. Longhaired LaPerms have full furnishings (hair inside the ears) and a covering of fur on and around the outer ears that resembles earmuffs. Expressive eyes can be any color.",
    "health": "Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. La Perms are generally healthy, however.",
    "history": "When a brown tabby barn cat named Speedy produced a litter of kittens in The Dalles, Oregon, in 1982, one of them was bald, with tabby markings on her skin, and big ears that were spaced wide apart. She looked like a little alien from outer space. When her coat began to develop, she looked even more different: it was curly. And that was the name she was given by owner Linda Koehl.\n\nCurly eventually produced her own kittens by various males in the area, including a Siamese and a Manx. All of her kittens shared their mother\u2019s curly coat, the result of a dominant mutation.\n\nGeneticists determined that the cats were distinct from the other rex, or curly-coated, breeds such as the Selkirk Rex, which first appeared in Montana in 1987, or the Devon and Cornish Rexes, which originated in Great Britain.\n\nEventually, status as a breed was sought for the curly-coated cats. They were given the name LaPerm and achieved recognition from The International Cat Association in 2002. The Cat Fanciers Association also recognizes the breed. To maintain their genetic diversity, LaPerms are outcrossed to non-pedigreed domestic shorthairs and longhairs.",
    "personality": "The clever LaPerm has a sense of humor. Often described as clownish, he is something of a mischief-maker who makes talented use of his paws to open doors, swipe things he wants or tap you on the shoulder for attention. He\u2019s not clingy, but he likes to be with you and will follow you around, sit on your shoulder or the top of your computer, or sit in your lap, whichever option is most convenient for him. He is moderately active and enjoys retrieving items that are thrown for him.\n\nDespite his reputation for getting into things, the LaPerm is pleasant to live with. He rarely uses his voice, and he is affectionate, gentle and patient with his people. Most are also welcoming to visitors as long as they were well socialized as kittens.",

Just make sure that early socialization takes place and boundaries are properly set on both sides--and supervise early interactions between kids and cats.\n\nWhen it comes to other household pets, the good-natured Lykoi fares well with many domestic animals. But always supervise early interactions between the new cat and existing pets. Sometimes these relationships are very much dependent on the individual pets' personalities.\n\nUltimately, early socialization really pays off with this breed. Make sure to reward your Lykoi for good behavior when you bring them home to your family!",
    "colorAndGrooming": "You'll usually see the Lykoi sporting a signature black or gray coat. Sometimes a silvery shade of white also appears. The breed's roan coat gives it an endearingly patchy appearance.\n\nWhen it comes to grooming, most Lykoi cats are fine with weekly brushing sessions--but make sure that you brush in a gentle fashion so that you don't irritate or hurt the cat's skin. Ask your vet for help on techniques if needed. Also, due to the cat's lack of hair, you'll need to give your Lykoi regular baths to\u00a0help keep oils in check.\n\nIn terms of climate, most Lykoi cats are adaptable, although they generally favor warmer temperatures. You should also always make sure that there's enough shade and fresh water available during the hotter months.",

It's also worth nothing that, due to the breed's short history, accurate predictions as to their average lifespan are not yet available.",
    "history": "If you dig into the history of the Lykoi, you'll find the breed credited to the breeders Brittney and Johnny Gobble along with Patti Thomas. After chancing across some unique looking litters, they let the cats breed, and the Lykoi emerged. The breed's name comes from the Greek word for wolves.\n\nThe Lykoi is officially acknowledged by the International Cat Association (TICA), and was granted full championship status in 2016.\n\nThese days, you may find Lykois in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. So make sure to consider adoption if you decide that this is the breed for you!",

As a breed, they're inquisitive, curious and great problem solvers--so you'll want to ensure that you have a stash of interactive cat toys available, plus a batch of play items that are rotated regularly. Keeping your Lykoi mentally stimulated will help bring out the best in this breed's personality.\n\nAlong with being a super smart kitty--and a feline that you can teach to play games of fetch--the Lykoi is generally an all around energetic cat who loves to stay active. Make sure you have adequate space and scope for climbing missions if you're considering adopting a Lykoi.\n\nFortunately, at the end of a hard day's playing, the Lykoi loves nothing more than to cuddle up with the humans in their life and enjoy some well deserved relaxation time.",

    "care": "Despite the length of the Maine Coon's coat, it has a silky texture that doesn't mat easily\u2014if you groom it regularly. It is easily cared for with twice weekly combing to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. Useful grooming tools include a stainless steel comb for removing tangles and what's called a \"grooming rake\" to pull out dead undercoat, which is what causes tangles when it's not removed. Use it gently, especially in the stomach area and on the tail. Maine Coons are patient, but they don't like having their hair pulled any more than you do. Check the tail for bits of poop stuck to the fur and clean it off with a baby wipe. Bathe a Maine Coon as needed, which can range from every few weeks to every few months. If their coat feels greasy or their fur looks stringy, they need a bath.\n\nBrush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Trim the nails every couple of weeks. Wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don't run the risk of spreading any infection. Check the ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear.\n\nKeep the Maine Coon's litter box spotlessly clean. Cats are very particular about bathroom hygiene, and a clean litter box will help to keep the coat clean as well.\n\nIt's a good idea to keep a Maine Coon as an indoor-only cat to protect them from diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car. Maine Coons who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such a beautiful cat without paying for it.",

    "colorAndGrooming": "A Maine Coon is a big, rugged cat with a smooth, shaggy coat who looks as if they could put in a full day mousing on a farm in all weather conditions. Indeed, they were built for just such work in the harsh Maine climate, and their breed standard reflects their heritage, calling for a medium-size to large cat with a well-proportioned body that is muscular and broad-chested. A Maine Coon has substantial, medium-length legs and large, round paws, well tufted with fur, to serve as \u201csnowshoes\u201d during winter.\n\nA heavy coat is shorter on the shoulders, longer on the stomach and britches (long fur on the upper hind legs), with a ruff in front and a long, furry tail waving a greeting. A medium-width head is slightly longer than it is wide and has a squarish muzzle. Large, well-tufted ears are wide at the base, tapering to a point, and large, expressive eyes are green, gold, greenish-gold or copper. White or bi-colored Maine Coons may have blue or odd eyes.\n\nThe brown tabby pattern is so common in this breed that many people don't know Maine Coons can come in any other colors or patterns. They might be surprised to learn that Maine Coons are found in solid colors that include black, red or white, all tabby colors and patterns, bi-color such as blue and white or red and white, and patterns such as tortoiseshell and calico.",
    "health": "Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Problems that may affect the Maine Coon include the following:\n\nHip dysplasia, which in severe cases can cause lameness.\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a form of heart disease that is inherited in Maine Coons. A DNA-based test is available to identify cats that carry one of the mutations that causes the disease.\n\nPolycystic kidney disease, a slowly progressive heritable kidney disease that can result in renal failure.\n\nSpinal muscular atrophy, a genetic disorder that affects skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs. A test is available to identify carriers and affected kittens.",
    "history": "The Maine Coon, as the name implies, hails from Maine, where the breed was known as a popular mouser, farm cat, and ship's cat, as far back as the early 19th century. They're a natural breed and little is known of their origins. Some say the Vikings brought them to North America, centuries before Columbus sailed the ocean blue. Others say that they're the descendants of longhaired cats belonging to Marie Antoinette, sent to America in advance of the doomed queen, who had hoped to escape there. Sea captains may have brought back longhaired cats that then mated with local shorthaired cats. One thing is for sure--the Maine Coon is not the result of a mating between a cat and a raccoon, even if their brown tabby coat and furry ringed tail suggest that biological impossibility. The resemblance is, however, how the cats got the \"Coon\" part of their name. In fact, Maine Coons who didn't have the brown tabby coat were called Maine Shags.\n\nThe first published reference to a Maine Coon comes from 1861 and was about a black-and-white cat named Captain Jenks of the Horse Marines. A female Maine Coon was named Best Cat in 1895 at a cat show held in Madison Square Garden. In Boston and New York, the home-grown felines were popular exhibits at cat shows, and when the Cat Fanciers Association was formed in 1908, the fifth cat registered was a Maine Coon named Molly Bond. But the invasion of glamourous Persian and exotic Siamese cats from England around the turn of the century spelled the end of the Maine Coon's popularity for about five decades. Things took a turn for the better in the 1960s, and the Maine Coon Breeders and Fanciers Association was formed in 1968. Today these big, beautiful cats are among the world's most popular breeds. But what really counts, of course, is that they are the official state cat of Maine.",
    "personality": "The good-natured and affable Maine Coon adapts well to many lifestyles and personalities. They like being with people and have the habit of following them around, but they aren't needy. They're happy to receive attention when you direct it their way, but if you're busy, they're satisfied to just supervise your doings. Close a door on them and they will wait patiently for you to realize the error of your ways and let them in. They're not typically a lap cat, but they do like to be near you.\n\nThey also retain their skill as a mouser. No rodents will be safe in a home where a Maine Coon resides. Even if you don't have any mice for them to chase, they'll keep their skills sharp by chasing toys and grabbing them with their big paws. A Maine Coon also enjoys playing fetch and will retrieve small balls, toys, or wadded-up pieces of paper. They can climb as well as any cat but usually prefer to stay on ground level. That's where their work is, after all. They're also very smart and will happily learn tricks or play with puzzle toys that challenge their brain.\n\nMaine Coons usually enjoy a kittenish love of play well into adulthood. Males, especially, are prone to silly behavior. Females are more dignified, but they aren't above a good game of chase. Not especially vocal, they make any requests in a soft chirp or trill.",

He lives peacefully with cats and dogs who respect his authority and can learn to leave birds and fish alone.

Always introduce pets slowly and in controlled circumstances to ensure that they learn to get along together.",
    "colorAndGrooming": "\u00a0\n\nThe Manx is known for his lack of a tail, but not every Manx is completely tailless. Some, known as \u201clongies,\u201d have a normal-length tail, and others, known as \u201cstumpies,\u201d have short tails. A Manx with no tail is called a \u201crumpy\u201d and one with just a rise of bone at the end of the spine is known as a \u201criser.\u201d You will see only rumpies and risers in the show ring, but cats with tails can be used in Manx breeding programs.\n\nA Manx has other distinguishing characteristics as well, including a round head with large round eyes, a stout, powerful body with a broad chest, short back and broad, round rear end, short front legs and long hind legs with muscular thighs. The long rear legs give him the appearance of a rabbit and may be the source of the \u201ccabbit\u201d myth.\n\nThe Manx has two different coat lengths: a short double coat or a longhaired double coat. The longhaired Manx is called a Cymric in some cat registries, but the Cat Fanciers Association simply considers the longhair a variety of Manx. In both lengths, the coat comes in many different colors, including various solids, tabbies, tortoiseshells and calicos. Chocolate and lavender colors and the pointed Himalayan pattern are not permitted.\n\nThis is a medium-size cat who weighs 8 to 12 pounds and feels surprisingly heavy when lifted. The Manx matures slowly and may not reach his full size until he is five years old.",

The condition affects approximately 20 percent of Manx cats, most often rumpies, and usually shows up by the time a kitten is 4 months old, a good reason to wait until that age before bringing a Manx kitten home.",

There are lots of cats with short tails or no tails, but the Manx (and his sister breed the longhaired Cymric) is the only one specifically bred to be tail-free. Sometimes jokingly said to be the offspring of a cat and a rabbit (however cute the idea, a \u201ccabbit\u201d is biologically impossible), the tailless Manx is the result of a genetic mutation that was then intensified by the cats\u2019 remote location on the Isle of Man, off the coast of Britain.\n\nThe cats are thought to date to 1750 or later, but whether a tailless cat was born there or arrived on a ship and then spread its genes throughout the island cat population is unknown. The island became known for tailless cats, and that is how the breed got its name of Manx. The Manx is recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association, The International Cat Association, and other cat registries.",
    "personality": "\u00a0\n\nThe Manx began life as a mouser, and he retains his fine hunting skills and alert nature. With a Manx around the house, you don\u2019t need a watchdog; you\u2019ve got a \u201cwatchcat\u201d who reacts rapidly and will growl threateningly or maybe even go on the attack at the sight or sound of anything out of the ordinary. If he sees that you aren\u2019t alarmed, he\u2019ll settle back down. When he\u2019s not protecting his family and property from mice, stray dogs, or other threats, however, the Manx is a mellow fellow: an even-tempered and affectionate cat who enjoys serene surroundings. That\u2019s not to say he is inactive. This is a happy, playful cat who likes to follow his favorite person through the house and assist with whatever he or she is doing. When you are ready to relax, though, the Manx will be in your lap, ready for a comfy nap. If no lap is available, he\u2019ll curl up on the nearest available spot that allows him to keep an eye on you. He \u201cspeaks\u201d in a quiet trill and will carry on a conversation if you talk to him.\n\nThe Manx has an adaptable nature if he is exposed to activity and other people as a young kitten. He will enjoy meeting new people, greeting them with a gentle head butt or cheek rub, and can adapt to a new home or family if such an upheaval in his life is necessary.\n\nThis is a smart cat who can learn tricks, including fetch and come, and is willing to walk on leash if taught early. He often likes to ride in the car, making him a great companion on long-distance trips. It\u2019s not unusual for the Manx to enjoy playing in water\u2014he is an island cat, after all\u2014and you may find him turning on faucets or \u201cfishing\u201d in a fountain. He is also good at learning how to open doors, so be sure anything you don\u2019t want him to have is under lock and key. Unlike most cats, the Manx is willing to accept boundaries and will usually respect your wishes if you tell him no when he jumps on the counter or scratches on your sofa. Just be sure you give him an acceptable alternative as thanks for his nice behavior.\n\nThe Manx is highly people-oriented. Choose him only if you can give him plenty of time and attention daily.",

In fact, when living with a Napoleon cat, you can expect the kitty to follow you around and want to snuggle up with you at any opportunity.\n\nThey also do great with kids and will bond very easily with humans. Just remember that the Napoleon is such a sociable kitty that they really need to be around people as much as possible, so consider another breed of cat if you're going to be away from the house for long periods of the day.\n\nBeyond being a total cuddle bug, the Napoleon also has a playful and curious side. They might not be the most athletic jumpers, mainly due to their short legs, but they are always up for a play session. It's best to add some interactive toys to the living environment to keep your cat mentally stimulated.",

    "childrenAndPets": "Nebelungs have a tolerant nature toward children who treat them kindly and respectfully, but they can be wary of younger children who pet them clumsily. Always supervise very young children when they want to pet the cat.\n\nThe Nebelung is accepting of other animals, including dogs, as long as they aren\u2019t chased or menaced by them. Introduce pets slowly and in controlled circumstances to ensure that they learn to get along together.",
    "colorAndGrooming": "The Nebelung looks much like the elegant-yet-muscular Russian Blue, but with a thick, shimmering, medium-length coat. Their general appearance is that of a long, sturdy, well-muscled cat.\n\nThe International Cat Association breed standard for the Nebelung calls for them to have a modified wedge-shaped head that is more pointed than rounded, although his long hair may give the head a rounded look. Large ears are wide at the base with pointed tips, and rich, deep-green eyes have a slightly oval shape and are set wide apart.\n\nKittens may have yellowish-green eyes, but by the time they are two years old they should have developed into the vivid green of maturity. The nose pad is charcoal gray.\n\nA long, slender neck sometimes looks shorter than it actually is because of the Nebelung\u2019s dense fur. The body is what\u2019s called semi-foreign, meaning it is moderate in shape, falling somewhere between the short, compact body of breeds such as Persians and the sleek angles of Oriental breeds such as the Siamese. It is athletic but not bulky, with a medium-boned body that is well proportioned.\n\nSupporting the body are long, medium-boned legs set on medium-size, well-rounded oval paws with generous tufting between the toes. The Nebelung looks as if they're walking on the balls of their feet. Their tail is at least as long as their body from shoulder blades to rear end, covered in fur that is longer than the body hair.\n\nThe Nebelung stands out for their luxurious coat and striking color. A medium-length double coat covers the body, increasing in length from the shoulder to the tail.\n\nMales have a distinct neck ruff, but females are not as well endowed. Behind the ears is feathering in a lighter shade of blue. Fur covering the back of the upper thighs gives the Nebelung the appearance of wearing pantaloons. The outer coat is fine and silky, topping an undercoat that is soft and downy.\n\nThe coat typically does not develop fully until the cat is two years old. It is thicker, longer and softer in winter.\n\nTo the uninformed, the Nebelung might look gray, but in cat show terms, they are blue all the way to the roots. It\u2019s ideal if the fur is silver-tipped, which makes the coat seem to glisten, but often silver tipping is noticeable only on the head and shoulders.\n\nSome Nebelung kittens are born with \u201cghost stripes,\u201d a reminder of the tabby gene that all cats carry, even if it isn\u2019t expressed in their coat, but these generally fade, leaving the cat with the solid blue coat of maturity.",
    "health": "Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. The Nebelung is generally healthy, however.\n\nAn owner\u2019s main concern will probably be this cat's hearty appetite, which can turn them from sleek to stout in no time.",
    "history": "The Nebelung cat breed was developed by Cora Cobb of the Nebelheim Cattery. Cobb was inspired by a kitten named Siegfried, the only longhaired blue kitten in a litter fathered by a longhaired black cat and born to a black domestic shorthair named Elsa.\n\nA second litter produced a female longhaired blue kitten whom Cobb named Brunhilde. Siegfried and Brunhilde became the foundation of a new breeding program and produced their first litter in 1986.\n\nRussian Blues who carried the gene for long hair were imported from eastern Europe in the late 1980s and contributed to the development of the breed. The International Cat Association gave the cats New Breed status in 1987 and full recognition in 1997. Nebelungs can be outcrossed to Russian Blues.\n\nThe Nebelung is also recognized by the Cat Fanciers Federation and the Traditional Cat Association.",
    "personality": "The Nebelung has a reputation as a gentle, quiet cat, somewhat shy, but don\u2019t get the wrong idea. This cat may have a reserved nature, but they love to play--being especially fond of retrieving--and enjoy jumping or climbing to high places where they can study people and situations at their leisure before making up their mind about whether they want to get involved.\n\nGuests will not receive this cat's immediate attention and may never see them unless they decide the humans are worthy of their notice, but toward family members, especially their favored person, the Nebelung is ever loyal, following them through the house and even riding on a shoulder.\n\nThe Nebelung is a sensitive cat who doesn\u2019t like to be ignored and will be hurt if they don\u2019t receive the same amount of affection they give. Lack of attention can cause them to become anxious or fearful.\n\nWhile the Nebelung loves your company, they're capable of entertaining themselves during the day while you are at work. Unlike some active, intelligent breeds, they're not destructive but move through the house with the lithe grace of a Russian ballerina.\n\nWhen you are at home, their subtle sense of humor and manual dexterity will never fail to entertain. Just make sure you laugh with them, not at them. They have a strong sense of self-worth and don\u2019t like being made fun of.\n\nThis is a cat who does best in a quiet, stable environment. They don\u2019t like change, and it\u2019s especially important to them that meals arrive on time. Count on them to be a faithful alarm clock in the morning--not so you don\u2019t miss work, but so they don\u2019t miss a meal.\n\nIf you take the time to develop a relationship with a Nebelung, your reward will be a deep bond with this loving cat.",

    "health": "Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Norwegian Forest Cats are generally healthy, with a long life span of 14 to 16 years. The following diseases have been seen in the breed:\n\n\u00a0\n\nGlycogen Storage Disease IV, a rare heritable condition that affects metabolism of glucose. \u00a0Most kittens with the disease are stillborn or die within a few hours of birth, but occasionally a kitten will not show signs until about 5 months of age and usually die within a few months. A DNA test is available that can identify affected and carrier cats.\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a form of heart disease that is inherited in some cat breeds such as the Maine Coon. Heritability has not been proven in the Norwegian Forest Cat.\n\nPolycystic kidney disease, a genetic condition that progressively destroys the kidneys. No DNA test for the disease is available for Norwegian Forest Cats, but the disease can be detected through ultrasound as early ass 10 months of age.\n\nRetinal dysplasia, an eye defect that causes spots on the retina but does not worsen the cat\u2019s vision.",
    "history": "The Norwegian Forest Cat is native to Norway, with a history going back hundreds and maybe thousands of years. He figures in fairy tales and legends, one being that the Norse goddess Freya\u2019s chariot is pulled by six giant cats. Where or how the cats originated remains a mystery. They may be the descendants of longhaired cats from Turkey, brought back from Byzantium by Scandinavian warriors who served the Byzantine Empire, or they may be related to the Siberian cat from Russia. They could have been Viking booty, or they could simply have been the result of natural selection: shorthaired cats whose adaptations to the harsh, near-Arctic climate produced descendants with woolly undercoats and long topcoats that shed water with ease.\n\nFor centuries, the skogcatt\u2014a Norwegian word that translates as \u201cforest cat\u201d\u2014survived by his wits or offered his services as a mouser to farmers and housewives in exchange for shelter in barns, stables or homes. In 1938, the cats were exhibited at a show in Oslo, but World War II interrupted any plans for developing them as a breed. Fortunately, they survived the war, just barely, but there were still some hard decades ahead and little was done with them until the 1970s. In 1977, they were finally registered as a breed with Europe\u2019s Federation Internationale Feline. Two years later, a pair of NFCs was exported to the United States for the first time. The breed has since become popular in Europe and the U.S.",
    "personality": "The gentle and friendly Norwegian Forest Cat\u2014Wegie, for short\u2014is fond of family members but does not demand constant attention and petting. He is satisfied to be in the same room with people and will entertain himself if no one is home. Although he appreciates human company, he can be a bit reserved with visitors. Even with family, he\u2019s not much of a lap cat, but a nice scritch between the ears or beneath the chin is always welcome, and he\u2019ll usually reciprocate with a nice head butt or cheek rub. He communicates with classic Scandinavian restraint. His quiet voice is employed only when he needs something\u2014dinner on time, perhaps\u2014and rises only if he is ignored.\n\nNot surprisingly, this large and athletic cat is a climber. You will often find him at the highest point he can reach in the home, and unlike some cats, he doesn\u2019t have any qualms about descending trees or other heights headfirst. Thanks to his heritage as a wilderness and farm cat, not to mention his waterproof coat, the Wegie thinks nothing of fishing in a body of water for a nice meal. Aquarium and koi pond denizens, beware! While he loves the outdoors, he is content to live quietly in a home.\n\nThis is a smart, independent cat who learns quickly and has an alert nature.

Like the Abyssinian, which was one of his ancestors, the Ocicat has what\u2019s called an agouti coat, meaning that each hair has several bands of color (the exception is the tip of the tail). The spots are formed where those bands of color meet.\n\nRows of round spots run along the spine, and more spots are scattered across the shoulders and rear end, extending down the legs. Broken \u201cbracelets\u201d of spots encircle the legs and broken \u201cnecklaces\u201d adorn the throat. Large, well-scattered spots appear on the side of the body and on the belly. The tail has what look like horizontal brushstrokes going \u2018round it, sometimes alternating with spots. Markings around the eyes and on the cheeks make the Ocicat look as if he has been at work with a mascara tube. The forehead is marked with an M (for mischief, no doubt) and small spots cover the lower neck and shoulders.\n\nSome Ocicats have classic, mackerel and ticked tabby coats, which are beautiful, but aren\u2019t correct for the show ring. Those cats have the same great Ocicat personality, however, and make wonderful pets.\n\nThe Ocicat has a medium-size to large body. He is muscular yet graceful. Large ears corner the modified wedge-shaped head. Some Ocicats have tufts of fur that extend vertically from the tips of the ears. Large almond-shaped eyes angle slightly upward and can be any color except blue. The lengthy tail has a dark tip.",
    "health": "Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature.

Some Ocicats have also been diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the most common form of heart disease in cats. Their Siamese and Abyssinian heritage may also predispose them to renal or liver amyloidosis and early periodontal disease.\n\n\u00a0",
    "history": "You aren\u2019t going dotty when you see an Ocicat. You are indeed seeing a small spotted cat, but he\u2019s not wild. Far from it. The Ocicat was created through crosses between Siamese, Abyssinian and American Shorthair cats. He might be named after the ocelot, a small South American wild felid, but he\u2019s all domestic cat.\n\nThe Ocicat is one of those happy accidents that sometimes occur in cat breeding. In an attempt to achieve Abyssinian points in her Siamese cats, breeder Virginia Daly crossed a sealpoint Siamese and a ruddy Abyssinian in 1964. The resulting kittens looked like Abys, and when she crossed one of them with a Siamese, she got not only Aby-pointed Siamese but also one kitten who had an ivory-colored coat dotted with gold spots. She named him Tonga and sold him as a pet, but when repeat breedings produced more spotted kittens, they became the foundation of a new breed. American Shorthairs were also used in their development, to add greater size and bring in the silver color.\n\nOcicats were recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association and The International Cat Association in 1987. They are also recognized by all other cat registries.",
    "personality": "The devoted and playful Ocicat loves people and will trail their footsteps through the house or ride on a shoulder. Guests are welcomed by this generally social cat as new opportunities for petting or lap sitting. Ocicats don\u2019t even mind being carried around as long as they are with you. As with any animal, they come in a range of personalities, so some are more shy than others.\n\nFavorite activities include retrieving toys and learning to walk on a leash. Ocicats are highly intelligent and learn tricks easily. Puzzle toys are a good way to keep them occupied and entertained. Carefully put away anything you don\u2019t want him to have. He is perfectly capable of figuring out how to open doors or undo latches.\n\nHis Siamese ancestors bequeathed the Ocicat a tendency to be vocal, but he is not as loud or as demanding. He is sensitive and will respond to nothing more than a verbal correction.\n\nAlthough the Ocicat is adaptable, he doesn\u2019t like being left alone. Be sure he has another cat or dog as a companion if you aren\u2019t home during the day.",

    "care": "The short, fine coat of the Oriental Shorthair is easily cared for. Comb it every couple of weeks with a stainless steel comb or soft bristle brush to remove dead hair, then polish it with a soft cloth to make it shine.\n\nBrush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don\u2019t run the risk of spreading any infection. Check the ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear.\n\nKeep the Oriental\u2019s litter box spotlessly clean. Cats are very particular about bathroom hygiene.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to keep an Oriental as an indoor-only cat to protect him from diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car.

He gets along with cats and dogs who respect his authority. Always introduce pets slowly and in controlled circumstances to ensure that they learn to get along together.",
    "colorAndGrooming": "Except for color, the Siamese and the Oriental are indistinguishable, having a svelte but muscular body with long lines and a wedge-shaped head that is long and tapering from the narrow point of the nose outward to the tips of the ears, forming a triangle. The unusually large ears are wide at the base and pointed at the tip, giving them the same triangular shape as the head. Medium-size eyes are almond-shaped.\n\nThe body is often described as tubular and is supported by long, slim legs, with the hind legs higher than the front legs. The Oriental walks on small, dainty, oval paws and swishes a long, thin tail that tapers to a fine point. Oriental Longhairs have a medium-length coat that is fine and silky. It is longest on the plumed tail. Often nicknamed \u201cOrnamentals\u201d because of their extensive color palette, Orientals come in more colors and patterns than any other breed, including solid, shaded, smoke, parti-color, bi-color and tabby. Depending on the coat color, the eyes may be blue, green, or odd (one blue and one green).",
    "health": "Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. The same problems that may affect the Siamese can also affect the Oriental, including the following:\n\n\u00a0\n\nAmyloidosis, a disease that occurs when a type of protein called amyloid is deposited in body organs, primarily the liver in members of the Siamese family\n\nAsthma/bronchial disease\n\nCongenital heart defects such as aortic stenosis\n\nCrossed eyes\n\nGastrointestinal conditions such as megaesophagus\n\nHyperesthesia syndrome, a neurological problem that can cause cats to excessively groom themselves, leading to hair loss, and to act frantically, especially when they are touched or petted\n\nLymphoma\n\nNystagmus, a neurological disorder that causes involuntary rapid eye movement\n\nProgressive retinal atrophy, for which a genetic test is available",
    "history": "The Oriental is best described as a color remake of the original \u201cblack and white\u201d Siamese. The breed was developed using Siamese as the foundation breed and then crossing them with other breeds. The original intent was to broaden the Siamese gene pool in Britain because so many breeding programs had been devastated during World War II. Crosses with Russian Blues, British Shorthairs, Abyssinians and domestic shorthairs produced kittens without the pointed Siamese pattern, which were then bred back to Siamese. In just a few generations, breeders produced cats that looked exactly like Siamese, except for the variety of colors and patterns they displayed, as well as cats with the traditional pointed pattern. Cats with Siamese points were used in Siamese breeding programs, but the non-pointed cats became the basis for a new breed: the Oriental. When the cats began to be imported into the United States in the 1970s, crosses with American Shorthairs produced yet more colors and patterns. A longhaired variety was also developed. Today Orientals come in more than 300 colors and patterns, including pointed varieties. Pointed Orientals are not accepted by all cat associations, and some require them to be shown as Siamese.",
    "personality": "The Siamese and the Oriental might differ in color, but beneath the skin they are identical. The Oriental is talkative and opinionated. He will tell you exactly what he thinks, in a loud, raspy voice, and he expects you to pay attention and act on his advice. Orientals are extremely fond of their people. They like to be \u201chelpful\u201d and will follow you around and supervise your every move. When you are sitting down, an Oriental will be in your lap, and at night he will be in bed with you, probably under the covers with his head on the pillow.\n\nDo not get an Oriental if living with a chatty busybody would drive you insane. On the other hand, if you enjoy having someone to talk to throughout the day, an Oriental can be your best friend. Just be sure you have time to spend with this demanding and social cat. Orientals do not like being left alone for long periods, and if you work during the day it can be smart to get two of them so they can keep each other company.\n\nThe Oriental is highly intelligent, agile and athletic, and loves to play. Keep his busy brain active with puzzle toys and his body exercised with teaser toys that he can chase and a big cat tree he can climb. He is fully capable of opening doors and drawers or rifling through your purse in search of something interesting or shiny to play with. Never leave him without any form of entertainment, or you will likely come home to find that he has reprogrammed your DVR to record only nature shows or at the very least decided that your toilet paper rolls and tissue boxes look better empty.\n\nChoose an Oriental if you look forward to spending time with and interacting with your cat. This is a loyal and loving feline who will pout and pine if given little or no attention. In the right home, however, he thrives for years.",

    "care": "The most important thing to understand about caring for a Persian is the need for daily grooming. That long, beautiful coat doesn\u2019t stay clean and tangle-free on its own. It must be gently but thoroughly combed and brushed every day, and regular bathing\u2014at least once a month\u2014is a good idea.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the litter box issue. Litter may become lodged in a Persian\u2019s paws or coat. If the cat and the litter box aren\u2019t kept scrupulously clean, a Persian is more likely than most to just stop using the box.\n\nExcessive tearing can be a problem in this breed, so wipe the corners of the eyes clean daily to prevent under-eye stains from forming. Brush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to keep a Persian as an indoor-only cat. She\u2019s not a scrapper and would fare poorly against other cats, dogs, coyotes and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors. Nor is the Persian\u2019s coat made for shedding dirt, leaves and stickers. Letting a Persian outdoors just means that much more time spent grooming the cat.

    "colorAndGrooming": "The Persian has a distinctive appearance: a large, round head; large, round eyes; a short nose; full cheeks; and small ears with rounded tips. The head is supported by a short, thick neck and a deceptively sturdy, muscular body\u2014a type known as \u201ccobby.\u201d A Persian\u2019s legs are short, thick and strong with large, round, firm paws. The tail is short but proportional to the length of the cat\u2019s body.\n\nA long, thick, shiny coat with a fine texture completes the Persian\u2019s look. It\u2019s long all over the body and includes an immense ruff around the neck, a deep frill between the front legs, long ear and toe tufts, and a full \u201cbrush,\u201d or tail.\n\nPersians can come in different \u201clooks.\u201d Some, known as Peke-face Persians, have an extremely flat face. Think twice about the breathing problems such a cat might have before deciding to get one. \u201cDoll-face\u201d Persians are said to have a more old-fashioned appearance, with a face that is not as flat as the show Persian or the Peke-face Persian.\n\nPersians of all stripes stand out for their infinite variety of coat colors and patterns. Imagine, if you will, seven solid color divisions\u2014white, blue, black, red, cream, chocolate and lilac\u2014plus silver and golden division colors of chinchilla and shaded silver or golden and blue chinchilla and blue shaded silver or golden; and then there are the shaded, smoke, tabby, calico, particolor and bicolor divisions. That\u2019s not counting the various pointed patterns of the Himalayan. Eye color is related to coat color.

    "history": "The Persian is an old breed. To those who love this elegant cat, it will come as no surprise that the longhaired beauty originated in the cradle of civilization: Mesopotamia, which was later known as Persia and is now modern-day Iran. The breed\u2019s long hair was probably the result of a natural mutation, and its striking appearance attracted the attention of 17th-century Italian nobleman and world traveler Pietro Della Valle, who is credited with bringing the first longhaired cats to Europe in 1626. At that time, the cats had shiny, silky gray fur, but thanks to selective breeding Persians are now found in a kaleidoscope of colors, including bi-color (a color plus white).\n\nUntil the late 19th century, when breeding and showing cats became popular, longhaired cats from Persia, Turkey, Afghanistan and other exotic locales were known simply as \u201cAsiatic\u201d cats and were often bred together. At the Crystal Palace cat show in 1871, Persian-type cats were among the breeds exhibited. They were popular pets of the time and had a special cachet because of Queen Victoria\u2019s fondness for the breed. Even in the Victoria era, association with a \u201ccelebrity\u201d ensured an animal\u2019s desirability.\n\nThrough selective breeding, cat fanciers began to mold the Persian to its present-day appearance. They bred cats to have a round head, short face, snub nose, chubby cheeks, small, rounded ears, big eyes, and a sturdy body. Their fur was longer than that of the Angora cat, and they had shorter legs. Soon, the Persians surpassed the Angoras in popularity.\n\nIn the United States, where they were first imported in the late 19th century, they also became favorites, edging out the longhaired Maine Coon cat, which had once held pride of place as an American sweetheart. In the little more than a century since, the Persian has become the most beloved cat breed in the world, prized for its beautiful appearance and sweet personality.",
    "personality": "The dignified and docile Persian is known for being quiet and sweet. She is an ornament to any home where she can enjoy sitting in a lap\u2014surely her rightful place\u2014being petted by those who are discerning enough to recognize her superior qualities, and playing house with kind children who will gently comb her hair, wheel her around in a baby buggy, then serve her tea at their parties. Persians are affectionate but discriminating. They reserve their attention for family members and those few guests whom they feel they can trust.\n\nLoud environments aren\u2019t a Persian\u2019s style; they are sedate cats who prefer a serene home where little changes from day to day. With large, expressive eyes and a voice that has been described as soft, pleasant and musical, Persians let their simple needs be known: regular meals, a little playtime with a catnip mouse or feather teaser, and lots of love, which they return tenfold. This is one cat who is unlikely to climb up your curtains, jump on your kitchen counters, or perch on top of your refrigerator. She is perfectly happy to rule her domain from the floor or more accessible pieces of furniture. When you are at work or are busy around the house, the Persian is content to adorn a chair, sofa or bed until you are free to admire her and give her the attention she willingly receives but never demands.",

Some breeders wanted to introduce new colors and patterns while others thought it was important to widen the breed\u2019s gene pool. Because the breeding of Ragdolls was strictly controlled by that breed\u2019s founder, Ann Baker, a new group formed to create its own breed. They outcrossed to Persians, Himalayans and domestic longhaired cats, to increase the size and to bring about other changes in appearance that would differentiate the Ragamuffin from the Ragdoll. The name Ragamuffin was chosen in part as an homage to the founding breed.\n\nCat associations that recognize the Ragamuffin are the United Feline Organization\u2014the first to do so\u2014the American Cat Fanciers Association, the American Association of Cat Enthusiasts, and the Cat Fanciers Federation. The Ragamuffin most recently gained full recognition from the Cat Fanciers Association, in February 2011.",
    "personality": "Like his cousin the Ragdoll, the Ragamuffin is a huggable lug who wants nothing more than to follow his people around and sit in a lap whenever possible. A nice combination of sweet and smart, he is often described as puppylike for his friendly personality and willingness to play fetch, learn tricks and walk on a leash. He greets visitors warmly and would meet you at the door with a martini if only he had opposable thumbs.\n\nThe Ragamuffin is known for his docile nature. He loves to be held like a baby and will completely relax into your arms. Ragamuffins like to play but are good about limiting their attentions to their toys and scratching posts, not your furniture. It is rare to nonexistent for them to lay a claw on a person.\n\nThis is a mellow cat but one who craves attention. Don\u2019t get a Ragamuffin if you will have to leave him alone for many hours every day.",

    "care": "A Ragdoll\u2019s moderately long fur has little undercoat, which means it is less likely to mat and shed, but that doesn\u2019t mean the cats need no grooming. Comb it twice a week with a stainless steel comb to remove dead hair that can cause tangles. Be sure to comb the fur on the legs thoroughly, especially where the leg meets the body, where mats are most likely to occur. A rubber curry brush will smooth the fur after you comb it and remove any remaining loose hairs. If you are gentle and don\u2019t pull their hair, Ragdolls will love the attention they receive from you during grooming time.\n\nNote that seasonal changes as well as hormonal fluctuations in unaltered cats can affect the length of the coat. The coat will be at its peak in winter. Ragdolls that have been spayed or neutered will usually have a lush coat year-round because they lack the hormonal fluctuations that occur in unaltered cats.\n\nCheck the tail for bits of poop stuck to the fur and clean it off with a baby wipe. Bathe a Ragdoll as needed, which can range from every few weeks to every few months. If his coat feels greasy or his fur looks stringy, he needs a bath.\n\nBrush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Trim the nails every couple of weeks. Wipe the corners of the eyes with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don\u2019t run the risk of spreading any infection. Check the ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear.\n\nKeep the Ragdoll\u2019s litter box spotlessly clean. Cats are very particular about bathroom hygiene, and a clean litter box will help to keep the coat clean as well. Speaking of litter boxes, a large cat like the Ragdoll needs a box that is super-sized to ensure that he has plenty of room to turn around and squat.\n\nRagdolls usually go through several growth spurts as they mature. These can continue off and on until the cat is four years old. Don\u2019t be deceived by the pad of fat on the belly, which is a trait of the breed. Until you are sure they have reached their mature size, make sure they always have plenty of food available to fuel their growth.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to keep the gentle Ragdoll as an indoor-only cat to protect him from attacks by dogs or coyotes, diseases spread by other cats, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car. Ragdolls who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such a beautiful cat without paying for it.",

He rarely extends his claws when playing, and he usually doesn\u2019t mind playing dress-up, riding in a baby buggy or being a guest at a tea party. Because of their large size, males are an especially good choice for families with children.\n\nOf course, you should always supervise young children to make sure they don\u2019t torment the cat. And with a cat this size, it\u2019s essential to teach children how to support the cat, with one arm beneath the front legs and one beneath the hind legs. Never hold a Ragdoll with the hind end hanging down.\n\nHe is happy to live with other cats and cat-friendly dogs, too, thanks to his amiable disposition. Introduce pets slowly and in controlled circumstances to ensure that they learn to get along together.",
    "colorAndGrooming": "Ragdolls stand out for their large size, semi-long coat in a pointed pattern, and sparkling blue eyes. They are among the largest of the domesticated cats, with some males weighing in at 20 pounds or more. A Ragdoll has a light-colored body with a darker face, legs, tail and ears. He comes in three patterns: mitted and bicolor, both of which have white, and colorpoint, which has no white. Ragdolls don\u2019t reach their full size and coat development until they are three to four years old.\n\nThe Cat Fanciers Association breed standard says the Ragdoll should have a large, broad head in a modified wedge shape. All sides of the head should be of equal length and the muzzle should be gently rounded. The eyes are described as vivid blue ovals. Medium-size ears have rounded tips and tilt forward. Supporting the head is a heavy, strong neck, which segues into a large and long body that is broad, solid and heavy-boned. The heavy-boned legs are moderately long, with the hind legs longer than the front legs. Large round paws are tufted with fur, and the long tail looks like a waving plume.\n\nThe Ragdoll has a silky coat that is moderately long. It\u2019s short on the face, blossoms into a ruff around the neck, shortens again on the shoulder blades, then lengthens toward the tail, which is fully feathered with fur. Depending on the association, the coat comes in four patterns--bi-color, van, mitted and colorpoint\u2014up to six colors: seal, blue, chocolate, lilac, red, and cream, and points that may be solid, lynx, tortie, or torbie (tortie and lynx). That adds up to many different possibilities when it comes to color and pattern.\n\nMitted Ragdolls are just what they sound like: they have four white feet, plus a white chin and belly, and sometimes a white spot on the face that may look like a blaze, star or hourglass. Bi-colors have even more white than mitteds, including on the chest and belly and sometimes on the back. On the face they may have a white inverted V-shape. Vans have the most white on the body, and Colorpoints have no white.\n\nRagdolls sold as pets may have slight cosmetic imperfections that make them unsuitable for the show ring. These might include ears set higher on the head than preferred, a nose that doesn\u2019t turn up at the tip, eyes that aren\u2019t Crater Lake-blue, or maybe mitts that don\u2019t go up high enough on the hind legs. As long as they have the sweet, loving Ragdoll temperament, none of that really matters for a cat who will be a beloved companion instead of a show-ring star.",
    "health": "Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Problems that may affect the Ragdoll include the following:\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a form of heart disease that is inherited in Ragdolls. A DNA-based test is available to identify cats that carry one of the mutations that causes the disease.\n\nIncreased risk for calcium oxalate bladder stones\n\nA predisposition to FIP (feline infectious peritonitis)",
    "history": "In the family of cat breeds, Ragdolls are among the younger siblings. The cats were first developed by breeder Ann Baker in Riverside, California, in the 1960s. Baker\u2019s foundation stock consisted of Josephine, a domestic longhair whose white coat concealed the genes for either a seal mitted or black tuxedo pattern, and various other longhaired cats of unknown ancestry that she owned or found in her neighborhood.\n\nBaker selected for cats with gentle, placid personalities, large size, and beautiful long coats characterized by a Himalayan pattern, the name for the \u201cpoints\u201d seen on Siamese-type cats. The result was a cat she called the Ragdoll, for its propensity to flop happily into the arms of anyone who picked it up. Later, Persians, Birmans and Burmese may also have contributed to the Ragdoll\u2019s development.\n\nBaker made many unusual claims about the cats\u2019 development, including alien influence, CIA experiments, and infusions of human genes, but that is all they are: claims, with no basis in fact. Other people had begun breeding Ragdolls as well. They broke away from Baker and formed the Ragdoll Fanciers Club International, with the goal of standardizing the breed and achieving recognition by cat registries.\n\nThe Cat Fanciers Association began registering the\u00a0cats in 1993 and gave them full recognition in 2000. Most registries now recognize the breed, including the American Cat Fanciers Association and The International Cat Association. Ragdolls are not outcrossed to any other breeds.",
    "personality": "Unlike many cats, Ragdolls are notable for collapsing into the arms of anyone who holds them, even if they are cradled on their back. They love their people, greeting them at the door, following them around the house, and leaping into a lap or snuggling in bed whenever given the chance. They often learn to come when called or to retrieve toys that are thrown for them.\n\nThe word most often used to describe them is docile, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are inactive. They like to play with toys and enter into any family activities. With positive reinforcement in the form of praise and food rewards when they do something you like, Ragdolls learn quickly and can pick up tricks as well as good behaviors such as using a scratching post. In a small, sweet voice, they remind you of mealtime or ask for petting but are not excessively vocal.\n\nRagdolls have nice manners and are easy to live with. You will find a Ragdoll on your sofa or bed, but generally not much higher than that. He prefers to stay on the same level with his people rather than the highest point in a room.",

The Cat Fanciers Association breed standard for the Russian Blue calls for him to have a head that is a smooth, medium-size wedge shape with a blunt muzzle. The broad wedge of the head and its flat skull are often described as cobra-like, although that is much too dangerous a description for this sweet-natured cat. Regal is perhaps a better term. Large ears are wide at the base with pointed tips, the interior lined with thin, translucent skin, and rounded vivid green eyes are set wide apart. A long, slender neck segues into high shoulder blades and a fine-boned body that is firm and muscular, covered with a short, thick double coat with a plush texture, often described as similar to that of a seal or beaver. If you were to run your fingers through a Russian Blue\u2019s coat, the patterns they made would remain until they were petted smooth. The body is supported by long, fine-boned legs set on small, slightly rounded paws with pads that are a pinky lavender or mauve shade. The tail is long but in proportion to the body.\n\nThe Russian Blue stands out for his coat color. To the uninformed, he might look gray, but in cat show terms he is an even, bright blue with silver-tipped hairs that make him seem to glisten. Some Russian Blue kittens are born with \u201cghost stripes,\u201d a reminder of the tabby gene that all cats carry, even if it isn\u2019t expressed in their coat, but these generally fade, leaving the cat with the solid blue coat of maturity.\n\nYou might think that a Russian Blue would only come in blue, and in CFA that is true, but other cat associations have more liberal breed standards. In Australia and New Zealand, the cats are called \u201cRussians\u201d and come in white and black as well as the traditional blue. The American Cat Fanciers Association permits black Russians.",

    "history": "As with so many cat breeds, little is known of the Russian Blue\u2019s origins. He probably does come from Russia\u2014his thick coat is surely that of a cat from colder climes\u2014and he is considered a natural breed, meaning Matushka Nature created him, not the handiwork of humans. The Russian Blue\u2019s development as a breed, however, took place primarily in Britain and Scandinavia, starting in the late nineteenth century, when showing and breeding cats became a popular activity.\n\nThe Russian Blue made his first appearance on the world stage of the cat fancy at an exhibit of cats held at London\u2019s Crystal Palace in 1875. Labeled an Archangel Cat, because he was said to be from the Russian island of Archangel, he competed against other blue cats of varying types. A newspaper report of the show described the Russian Blue as \u201cvery handsome\u201d and \u201cparticularly furry,\u201d adding \u201cThey resemble mostly the common wild grey rabbit.\u201d Other early names by which the breed was known were Maltese and Foreign Blue.\n\nA British cat fancier named Mrs. Carew-Cox began importing the cats in 1890 and bred and showed them through the turn of the century. She described them as having short, silvery fur, large ears, wide-set eyes and lean faces, with sweet, intelligent personalities\u2014in short, much the same as the Russian Blue of today. In 1912, the cats were well enough established that they could be shown in a class of their own instead of being lumped together with other blue cats.\n\nWorld War II nearly put an end to the breed. Very few cats survived the years of privation, and British and Scandinavian breeders turned to other breeds, primarily the Siamese and the British Blue, to help revive their bloodlines. Because of the Siamese influence, the cats developed a more extreme look, and the texture of their coat changed. It took years to bring the breed back to its original appearance. That was achieved by combining British bloodlines, which emphasized plush, silvery coats, and Scandinavian bloodlines, which were known for producing cats with bright breen eyes and flat profiles. The result was the Russian Blue of moderate type seen today.\n\nRussian Blues were first imported to the United States in 1900, but it wasn\u2019t until after World War II that American breeders began to develop their own lines from cats imported in 1947. Today they are popular show cats as well as companions to those who know the secret of their sweet beauty.",

Guests will not receive his immediate attention and may never see him unless he decides they are worthy of his notice, but toward family members, especially his favored person, he is ever loyal, following them through the house and even riding on a shoulder. The Russian Blue is a sensitive cat who doesn\u2019t like to be ignored and will be hurt if he doesn\u2019t receive the same amount of affection he gives.

Outcrossing is no longer permitted now that the breed is established.\n\nThe International Cat Association (TICA) began registering Savannahs in 2001.

This is a confident, alert, curious, and friendly cat.\n\nWhile some cats are retiring sorts, most Savannahs are gracious hosts who will greet your guests with aplomb, as well as close companions who will want to spend time interacting with you. Be sure you have a well-developed sense of humor if you live with one of these cats; they are not above playing jokes on you. It takes a highly intelligent person to outwit a Savannah. You may need to switch faucet styles to prevent them from turning on their own private waterworks, or attach childproof locks to keep them out of cabinets.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to protect breakables.

    "colorAndGrooming": "With the way their small ears fit like a cap over their rounded head, the Scottish Fold is often described as resembling an owl. The ears range in appearance from a single fold, bent forward about halfway up the ear, to a double fold, somewhat tighter, and the triple fold, lying tight to the head, which is desirable for show cats.\n\nKittens are born with straight ears, which may or may not fold when they are about three weeks old. Wide open eyes gaze out at the world with a sweet expression. The medium-size body is also rounded, completed by a medium to long tail that sometimes ends in a rounded tip.\n\nA shorthaired Fold has a dense, plush coat with a soft texture. The longhaired variety has medium-long to long fur with britches (longer fur on the upper thighs), toe tufts, a plumed tail, and tufts of fur on the ears. They may also have a ruff around the neck.\n\nThe Scottish Fold comes in a number of colors and patterns, including solid, tabby, tabby and white, bicolor, and particolor. Eye color depends on coat color. For instance, white and bicolor cats can have blue eyes or odd eyes (where each eye is a different color).",
    "health": "Both pedigreed cats and mixed breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. A typical lifespan is 15 years. Problems that may affect the Scottish Fold include the following:\n\nDegenerative joint disease, especially in the tail but also in the ankle and knee joints, causing pain or poor mobility. It\u2019s important to handle the tail carefully if it has developed stiffness.\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a form of heart disease, has been seen in the breed, but it has not yet been proven to be a heritable form of the disease.",
    "history": "Often, the creation of a new cat breed hinges on a natural genetic mutation that occurs unexpectedly in an otherwise ordinary cat. Such was the case with the Scottish Fold. Members of the breed today can all trace their heritage back to Susie, a white cat with unusual folded ears who earned her keep as a mouser in a barn in Scotland's Tayside region.\n\nSusie might have lived her life in obscurity had she not been noticed in 1961 by a shepherd named William Ross who had an interest in cats. When Susie had kittens with a local tom, Ross acquired one of them, a female he named Snooks.\n\nIn the natural way of things, Snooks had kittens, and one, a male was bred to a British Shorthair. Thus began the development of what were first known as \"lop-eared cats,\" later as Scottish Folds, a nod to their country of origin and their defining characteristic.\n\nOther breeders became involved, and it was determined that the gene mutation for the fold was dominant, meaning that if one parent passed on a gene for straight ears and the other a gene for folded ears, the resulting kitten would have folded ears. A gene for long hair was another gift Susie passed on to her descendants. The longhaired variety is known as a Highland Fold in some associations.\n\nScottish Folds were first imported into the United States in 1971. By the mid-1970s, they had been recognized by most cat associations in North America. They can be outcrossed to American Shorthairs and British Shorthairs.\n\nIronically, they are not recognized as a breed in their country of origin over concerns that the folded ear might lead to ear infections or deafness and because of a related cartilage problem.",
    "personality": "After their ears, the first thing you will notice about a Scottish Fold is their habit of posing in odd positions\u2014flat out on the floor like a little frog, sitting up for all the world as if they were a meerkat on a nature program, or lying on their back, paws up in the air. And although you might assume that their ears are less mobile than those of other cats, such is not the case. Scottish Folds use those ears to communicate quite effectively, adding comments in a quiet, chirpy voice when necessary.\n\nThis is a smart, moderately active cat. The Scottish Fold enjoys teaser toys that test their agility and puzzle toys that challenge their intelligence. Their favorite activities include anything that involves human interaction.\n\nThere is nothing a Scottish Fold likes better than to be with their people, participating in whatever they are doing. They're a sweet cat who enjoys attention. The last thing they want is to be left alone for hours on end, so they're not the best choice unless someone is home during the day or you can give them the company of another cat.\n\nRest assured, however, that they will expect you to play with them when you get home from work or school--or at least sit down so they can get in a little lap time or curl up next to you while you watch television.",

Shorthairs have a ruff that is the same length as the fur on the rest of the body and plush curls on the tail that lie compactly. A longhaired Selkirk has a longer ruff that frames the face and plumy curls on the tail that stand out rather than lying demurely in place. With either length, the coat may appear most curly around the neck and on the belly and tail.\n\nThe coat comes in any genetically possible color or combination of colors.

Selkirk Rex are generally healthy, but be sure to ask a breeder about the incidence of any health problems in her lines and what testing has been done for those that are genetic in nature.",
    "history": "With a thick coat of woolly looking curls, the Selkirk is sometimes nicknamed the cat in sheep\u2019s clothing. Like his curly-coated cousins the Cornish and Devon Rexes, the Selkirk is the result of a natural genetic mutation, but he has a very different look, thanks to his dense coat and heavy-set body.\n\nThe Selkirk originated in Montana, where the first known cat of this type was born in 1987, one of a litter of six kittens found in an animal shelter. The others had the typical straight coat of a domestic shorthaired cat, but the curly-coated female was so unusual that she was brought to the attention of a local Persian breeder, Jeri Newman, who adopted her. Newman named her Miss DePesto and, out of curiosity, bred her when she was grown to a black Persian. Of the six kittens Miss DePesto produced, three had curly coats, indicating that the gene for the characteristic was dominant. That was not the case with the Cornish or Devon Rexes, which owe their wavy coats to a recessive gene. She also carried genes for long hair and a pointed coat, and both traits made an appearance in her descendants.\n\nNewman called the new breed Selkirk, after her stepfather, making it unique among cat breeds in being named for a person. She added Rex to indicate that the coat was curly.\n\nTo maintain genetic diversity and to give the cats a more pleasing appearance, she and other breeders outcrossed them not only to Persians but also to Exotics, American Shorthairs and British Shorthairs. The cats were recognized by The International Cat Association and the American Cat Fanciers Association in the 1990s and by the Cat Fanciers Association in 2000, although the CFA began registering the cats in 1992.",
    "personality": "The Selkirk is the relaxed Rex. His Persian and British Shorthair ancestors give him a placid, cuddly nature, but he is more active than those breeds and likes to play. People who live with him describe him as sweet and endearing, with a bit of a silly streak.\n\nTolerant and affectionate, the Selkirk is not always a lap cat, but he likes people and other animals. With his sociable nature, he dislikes being left alone for long periods. Keep this fun-loving cat entertained with a fishing-pole toy or flashlight beam, and he will be thrilled. Ignore him at your peril. He won\u2019t hesitate to demand attention in a small, quiet voice if he feels that he\u2019s not getting his due.",

The wedge-shaped head is long and tapering from the narrow point of the nose outward to the tips of the ears, forming a triangle. The unusually large ears are wide at the base, pointed at the tip, giving them the same triangular shape as the head. Medium-size almond-shaped eyes are always a deep vivid blue. The body is often described as tubular and is supported by long, slim legs, with the hind legs higher than the front legs. The Siamese walks on small, dainty, oval paws and swishes a long, thin tail that tapers to a fine point.\n\nThe short coat of the Siamese has a fine texture. In the Cat Fanciers Association, it comes in four colors: seal point, a pale fawn to cream body with deep seal brown points and deep brown nose leather and paw pads; chocolate point, an ivory body with milk chocolate-colored points and cinnamon-pink nose leather and paw pads; blue point, a bluish-white body with deep blue points and slate-colored nose leather and paw pads; and lilac point, a glacial white body with frosty pinky-gray points and lavender-pink nose leather and paw pads.\n\nThe International Cat Association allows for a range of colors beyond the four point colors recognized by CFA. They include tabby points, red points, cream points, silver tabby points, smoke points and particolor points.\n\nThe Traditional Cat Association recognizes two types of Siamese, the Traditional and the Classic, both with a very different look than the modern Siamese recognized by CFA, TICA and other cat associations. The TCA\u2019s Traditional Siamese has a round head and a big-boned, rounded body. The TCA\u2019s Classic Siamese is also big-boned but has a slightly more elongated body than the Traditional Siamese and a wide wedge-shaped head. They come in the same four colors recognized by CFA, plus albino.\n\nWhat about the Thai? The TICA breed standard calls for it to have modified wedge-shaped head of medium width with rounded cheeks and a muzzle that tapers to a rounded end, much like a tapered garden spade. The head is longer than it is wide, but not to an extreme degree. The eyes have a full almond shape and the ears are medium size to slightly large, with the tip pointing outward at a slight angle. The lithe, graceful body is moderately long but not tubular. Medium-length legs are graceful and are supported by medium-size oval-shaped paws. The tail is as long as the torso, tapering at the tip.

Ancient manuscripts depict the cats, but they were not seen in the West until the late nineteenth century, when they were exhibited at the Crystal Palace Cat Show in London. Not everyone appreciated their unusual appearance, but they quickly became fashionable pets. By the turn of the century, if not earlier, they were popular in the United States as well. President Rutherford B. Hayes (1877-1881) and his wife Lucy were the recipients of a Siamese cat shipped to them in 1878 by David B. Sickels, a U. S. diplomat stationed at the consulate in Thailand. A letter from Sickels detailing the gift is on file at the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center in Fremont, Ohio.\n\nAt first, only the cats with seal points\u2014a dark brownish-black\u2014were shown, but blue, chocolate and lilac-point Siamese were soon developed and accepted in the show ring. Today Siamese come in many different point colors and patterns, including tabby points and smoke points.\n\nThe Siamese itself is a natural breed, meaning its original pointed pattern was the result of a genetic mutation. The breed has contributed to the creation of many other breeds, including the Balinese, Oriental, the Himalayan division of the Persian, the Tonkinese and the Havana Brown.\n\nThe Siamese is recognized by all cat associations. The International Cat Association also recognizes the Thai, described as the original form of the native pointed cat of Thailand. In Thailand the cats are called Wichienmaat. Some people refer to it as an old-style Siamese. It shares the pointed coat and domineering personality of the Siamese but has a more moderate body type.",

The cats have been known in Russia for some 1,000 years and often figure in Russian folktales.\n\nAs in every culture, the cats were prized for their hunting ability by householders and shopkeepers. They kept mice and rats well away from stores of grain and other foods.\n\nSiberians were first imported to the United States in 1990 and were recognized by The International Cat Association in 1996. The American Cat Fanciers Association accepted the breed in 1999, followed by the Cat Fanciers Association in 2006. The breed is gaining popularity because it has a reputation for being hypoallergenic\u2014which may or may not be the case, depending on the individual person.",
    "personality": "The Siberian\u2019s heart is as warm as his homeland is cold. He loves people and wants to be near them, so expect this affectionate cat to follow you around, including to the bathroom, and to \u201chelp\u201d you with all of your reading, TV viewing, computer work and meal prep. Sitting in your lap while you comb his fur may well be the highlight of his day. When you come home from work, he might not have a martini waiting, but he will be pleased to tell you all about his day in quiet, pleasant trills and chirps, interspersed with a few meows and purrs. Guests will find him to be a genial host; this is not typically a cat who is shy in the presence of strangers.\n\nBesides being loving and attentive, the Siberian is also active and playful. He will instigate games of fetch by bringing you a favorite toy to throw. Any item can become a plaything for this clever cat, so keep jewelry or other potentially intriguing items out of his sight. Teaching him tricks is a fun and easy way to challenge his agile brain.\n\nBecause of his heritage as a forest dweller, he likes playing with water\u2014perhaps it\u2019s a genetic memory of going fishing for his supper. Don\u2019t be surprised if he enjoys splashing you in the tub, drinking from a fountain or faucet, or making puddles by batting his paw in his water dish. As befits a working and hunting cat, he\u2019s highly athletic and you may find him balancing atop a doorway or propelling himself to the highest point in the room. In fact, Siberian coaches may well be the secret to the success of Russian gymnasts.\n\nActivity and noise won\u2019t bother him a bit. His calm nature gives him the potential to be a therapy cat. If nothing else, he will be happy to snuggle with you when you\u2019re down with a cold or other illness. And although he loves attention, he\u2019s not needy and will wait patiently until you have time to devote to him.",

A test is available that can determine whether a cat is affected, a carrier, or clear of the disease. Fortunately, Singapuras with PKD can usually live a normal life.",
    "history": "The Singapura was developed in the 1970s from cats found in Singapore \u2014 the Lion City \u2014 by cat fanciers Hal and Tommy Meadow.\u00a0 Their cats Ticle, Pusse, Tes, George and Gladys, plus Chiko, adopted later from a shelter in Singapore, were the foundation of the pedigreed Singapura, although cats like them had probably lived in Southeast Asia for at least a decade if not longer.\n\nBrown cats and cats with agouti, or ticked, coats are common in the region, and there is likely some relationship to Siamese and Burmese cats. The ticked tabby gene is dominant to all other tabby patterns and is frequently seen in Southeast Asian cats. Small cats with a brown-ticked coat were known in Singapore from at least 1965. The Singapura as discovered by the Meadows may have resulted from matings between cats with the Abyssinian ticked tabby gene and the Burmese gene (which gave the brown color). A DNA study published in 2008 showed little to no difference genetically between the Burmese and the Singapura.\n\nThe Cat Fanciers Association recognized the breed in 1988, and it is also recognized by most other cat associations. In 1990, the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board adopted the Singapura as the island nation\u2019s travel mascot.",
    "personality": "The tiny Singapura has a tiny little voice, but this mischievous and active cat makes his presence known in other ways: chasing small balls down the hall, tapdancing on keyboards, climbing curtains or anything else that will place him on high, or jumping on your shoulder as you walk by to go for a ride. He retains his playfulness well into adulthood.\n\nThe Singapura loves people and isn\u2019t shy about meeting people. He likes being a lap cat and is an excellent bedwarmer on cold winter nights. Despite his busy nature, he is a gentle friend who will put aside his activities to keep you company when you\u2019re feeling under the weather. The rest of the time? Watch out \u2014 he is as curious as cats come and will be into anything that looks interesting. The Singapura does best in a home where he will have plenty of company \u2014 human or animal.",

    "childrenAndPets": "The active and social Snowshoe is a perfect choice for families with children and cat-friendly dogs. She will play fetch as well as any Retriever, learns tricks easily, and appreciates the attention she receives from children who treat her politely and with respect.",
    "colorAndGrooming": "The Snowshoe has a short, smooth coat that\u2019s easy to care for. Snowshoe kittens are born white. Their points (dark or patterned areas of fur on the tail, legs, head, and ears) begin to develop when they are a few weeks old and darken as the kitten matures. The body is usually a light cream color ranging to beige or tan with seal or blue points. Other point colors such as chocolate or lilac are difficult to produce and rarely seen. Those colors also provide little contrast with the white paws. Paw pads and nose leather can be pink; the same color as the points; or a combination of the two.\n\nBecause the Snowshoe\u2019s pattern is recessive and involves several gene factors, it\u2019s difficult to consistently achieve the desired look. No cat has perfect markings. Those who come closest to the ideal\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the ones you\u2019ll see in the show ring \u2014 have an inverted white \u201cV\u201d between the eyes and over the muzzle, two white mittens in the front and two white boots in the back. The more symmetrical the markings, the better. Markings that are acceptable but not preferred include a blaze on the face or white markings on the chin, throat, and stomach. It\u2019s best if all four feet are solid white with dark points separating the white foot color from the light body color. White that goes too high or too low on the leg or face is a flaw and may put a kitten into the \u201cpet quality\u201d category depending on her other qualities. In a perfect world, a Snowshoe won\u2019t have spots of the point color in the white areas or white streaks (called runners) going from the white areas into the points.\n\nA Snowshoe glances at you with large, wide eyes of sparkling blue. The eyes are described as walnut-shaped: larger and rounder than the Siamese eye, but not as round as the eye of a Persian.\n\nThe rectangular body is firm and muscular, but never bulky. The Snowshoe resembles a runner, not a wrestler, but is more powerful than she looks. When you pick her up, you may be surprised at how substantial she feels. Medium-large ears top the slightly rounded head, which should be as wide as it is long. Medium-size paws are oval and taper to the toes.",
    "health": "Both pedigreed and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. The Snowshoe is generally healthy, however. Occasionally, a Snowshoe may have a kink in her tail or crossed eyes \u2014 vestiges of her Siamese ancestry \u2014 but those cosmetic flaws don\u2019t affect her health or ability to be a great companion.",
    "history": "Like his ancestor the Siamese, the Snowshoe is a pointed cat, meaning she has a light-colored body with dark areas in seal or blue: the tail, legs, and ears, plus a mask around the eyes, broken up by an inverted V-shaped marking in white between blue eyes and over the muzzle. Four white paws punctuate the dark legs, with the front paws termed \u201cmittens\u201d and the rear paws \u201cboots.\u201d The body is more rounded than that of the Siamese, with short hair.\n\nThe appearance of the Snowshoe harks back to the late Victorian era, with photographic and silk-screen evidence of Siamese kittens with four white feet, but the breed we know today was not developed until the mid-20th century. White-pawed Siamese known as Silver Laces made a brief appearance in the 1950s, but it wasn\u2019t until the 1960s that Philadelphia Siamese breeder Dorothy Hinds-Daugherty decided to create a Siamese-type cat with white paws and a moderate body. She called them Snowshoes.\n\nDaugherty began with three white-pawed Siamese kittens and bred them to a domestic shorthaired cat with tuxedo markings (black coat and white belly, chest, throat, and paws \u2014 often with a black mask around the eyes). With intelligence from both sides of the family tree and the moderating influence of the domestic shorthair on the Siamese body type and personality, it\u2019s no wonder the new cats were seen to have potential both as companions and show animals.\n\nDaugherty eventually gave up breeding cats, but other breeders who saw merit in continuing to develop the interesting and beautiful cats carried on her work. The Cat Fanciers Federation recognized the Snowshoe in 1982, followed by American Cat Fanciers Association in 1990 and The International Cat Association in 1994. The Cat Fanciers Association does not yet recognize the breed.\n\nWhile the Snowshoe is a distinct breed, the cats are still sometimes bred back to Siamese or Oriental Shorthairs to maintain their traits. It\u2019s not easy to produce kittens with the desired markings, so the breed is uncommon, despite the ubiquity of Grumpy Cat.",
    "personality": "The Snowshoe is a unique individual who is always interesting to live with. A Snowshoe may be the bossy master or mistress of the home, the feline \u201cMom\u201d who\u2019s always checking in on you, the entertaining clown, or the needy best friend. In whatever guise she comes, you can expect her to be smart, active, and affectionate, although she may take her time warming up to visitors.\n\nA Snowshoe usually chooses a favorite person in the family, but she maintains cordial relationships with everyone. She stays close to the favored person and can often be seen leading them to something of the Snowshoe\u2019s interest.\n\nSnowshoes are smart and will often learn to open doors or perform tricks, including running feline agility courses. They like to play fetch, may walk on leash, and enjoy dabbling in running water. Some even take to swimming. This is an active cat who can often be found perching on top of the refrigerator or some other vantage point from where he can survey all that\u2019s going on.\n\nThanks to their Siamese heritage, Snowshoes tend to be \u201ctalkers.\u201d Fortunately, they have a soft, melodic voice that\u2019s easy on the ears. Plan to carry on many interesting conversations with your Snowshoe; she\u2019ll want to know all about your day, how you feel about the local school board election, and whether you think dinner will be soon. He won\u2019t hesitate to register any complaints with you about her meals or accommodations, but this sweet-tempered cat knows you catch more flies with honey than vinegar.\n\nSnowshoes are mellow and generally get along with other pets, including dogs. That said, it\u2019s certainly possible to end up with one who prefers to be the center of your world and will do best as an only cat.\n\nChoose a Snowshoe if you will enjoy spending time with and interacting with your cat. A Snowshoe likes company and would prefer not to be home alone all day. If you work long hours, she\u2019ll appreciate having a feline or canine friend.",

One of the unusual breeds exhibited at the Crystal Palace Cat Show in 1871 was an Abyssinian\u2014\u201ccaptured in the late Abyssinian War\u201d\u2014who took third place. The report on the cat show, published in the January 27, 1872, issue of Harper\u2019s Weekly, was the first known mention in print of the breed. Unfortunately, no records exist regarding the cats\u2019 origins, although myths and speculation abound, including claims that it was the cat of the pharaohs, and that it was created in Britain by crossing silver and brown tabbies with cats that had \u201cticked\u201d coats.\n\nToday, genetic evidence suggests that the cats came from Indian Ocean coastal regions and parts of Southeast Asia. British and Dutch traders may well have brought the cats from ports such as Calcutta, India, or the islands of Indonesia. A taxidermied specimen of a ruddy ticked cat exhibited in the 1830s at the Leiden Zoological Museum in The Netherlands, where he was labeled \u201cPatrie, domestica India,\u201d gives creedence to that theory. The cats were probably given the name Abyssinian because Zula, the cat exhibited at the Crystal Palace, was said to have been imported from Abyssinia (now Ethiopia). Early pedigrees show crosses to non-Abyssinian cats, which may explain the introduction of new coat colors and the gene for long hair.\n\nEnter the Somali. This longhaired variety of the Abyssinian was first noted in the early 20th century and probably came about when breeders introduced longhaired cats into their breeding programs to augment their stock\u2014especially after World War II, when Abys were few and far between\u2014but they weren\u2019t developed as a breed in their own right until the 1960s and 1970s. They were given the name Somali as a nod to that country\u2019s geographic status as the next door neighbor to Ethiopia (formerly known as Abyssinia).",
    "personality": "Like his sibling the Abyssinian, the Somali lives life to the fullest. He climbs higher, jumps farther, plays harder. Nothing escapes the notice of this highly intelligent and inquisitive cat, a quality that makes life with him both endlessly entertaining and continuously challenging. Staying a step ahead of a Somali, or even just keeping pace with him, requires the fancy footwork of a Fred Astaire, the brainpower of an Einstein and a sense of humor that never stops. You never know what he\u2019ll get into next, although you can assume that if you have something or are doing something, your Somali will want to investigate it closely.\n\nSometimes it may seem as if the Somali never sleeps. He is ever in motion, jumping up in the window to look at birds or squirrels, leaping on top of the refrigerator to supervise meal preparation, perching on your desk to watch your fingers move over the keyboard and then swiping at them so you\u2019ll pay attention to him instead. This is a playful, persistent cat who adores being the center of attention and will do anything to achieve and maintain that status.\n\nThe Somali loves to play, so plan on making or purchasing a variety of toys to keep him occupied. Ping-Pong balls, bottle caps, wadded-up pieces of paper, puzzle toys and teasers such as big peacock feathers will all amuse this busy and brainy cat. Teach him to retrieve at your peril. Once you start, he won\u2019t let you stop. He learns tricks quickly and many Abys enjoy running a feline agility course.\n\nA love of heights is a signal trait of the Somali. He likes to be as high up as possible and will appreciate having one or more ceiling-height cat trees. When those aren\u2019t available, he is perfectly capable of making his way to the uppermost point of any room. Fortunately, he is naturally graceful and rarely breaks items unless it is simply out of curiosity.\n\nSomalis are adaptable throughout their lives and fit well into any home where they are loved and given plenty of attention. In a home where people are at work or school during the day, the Somali does best with a companion, ideally another Somali or Aby, who can match his activity level. If left to his own devices, the Somali may well dismantle the house in his search for something interesting to do.\n\nBeware! The Somali can be addictive. Once you\u2019ve had one, you may find that no other cat will do.",

    "breedName": "Sphynx",
    "care": "Despite his bald body, a Sphynx requires at least as much grooming as cats with fur and maybe even more. Their skin must be kept moisturized with a gentle, scent-free lotion or oil, and they need weekly baths so as not to leave greasy spots on your furniture and clothing. Use a gentle baby shampoo or moisturizing shampoo and rinse thoroughly, especially between the folds of the wrinkles. If you begin bathing your Sphynx kitten while he is young, he will learn to accept and sometimes even enjoy baths. Baby wipes will help to keep him clean between baths.\n\nBrush the teeth to prevent periodontal disease. Daily dental hygiene is best, but weekly brushing is better than nothing. Wipe the corners of the eyes daily with a soft, damp cloth to remove any discharge. Use a separate area of the cloth for each eye so you don\u2019t run the risk of spreading any infection. Check the ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or soft damp cloth moistened with a 50-50 mixture of cider vinegar and warm water. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the interior of the ear.\n\nKeep the litter box spotlessly clean. Like all cats, Sphynx are very particular about bathroom hygiene.\n\nAlthough the Sphynx feels warm to the touch, he doesn\u2019t have a fur coat to keep him warm. If you\u2019re cold, he probably is too. Buy him a nice sweater or two to help him retain heat.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to keep a Sphynx as an indoor-only cat to protect him from diseases spread by other cats, attacks by dogs or coyotes, and the other dangers that face cats who go outdoors, such as being hit by a car. Sphynx who go outdoors also run the risk of being stolen by someone who would like to have such an unusual cat without paying for it. If your Sphynx has an outdoor enclosure where he can sunbathe, be sure to apply cat-safe sunscreen to his skin to prevent sunburn.",

Always introduce pets slowly and in controlled circumstances to ensure that they learn to get along together.",
    "colorAndGrooming": "Bald, wrinkled and potbellied, the Sphynx is sometimes proclaimed to be ugly, but only by those who have a shallow understanding of beauty. His unusual body shape and the physiological and emotional warmth he emits are what attract people to him.\n\nMuch like an apricot, the hard, muscular body of the Sphynx can be smooth or covered with a fine, soft down. The nose, toes, ears and tail may also have a light covering of fur. To hug him is to melt into the warmth of his suedelike coat. A Sphynx does not have a higher body temperature than other cats, but it seems like it because there is no fur to serve as insulation.\n\nA broad chest and a well-rounded abdomen give him the appearance of having eaten just a little too much at dinnertime, but he should not be fat. Supporting the body are firm, muscular legs set on oval paws with long, slender toes. Thick paw pads make the Sphynx look as if he is walking on \u201cair cushions.\u201d A long, slender, flexible tail is described as whiplike. A Sphynx with a little tuft of fur on the end of the tail is said to have a lion tail. Sphynx kittens are heavily wrinkled, but as they grow the wrinkles smooth out, although some remain throughout the cat\u2019s life. A Sphynx should not be so wrinkled that eyesight or other functions are compromised.\n\nThe head of the Sphynx is a modified wedge shape, slightly longer than it is wide, with prominent cheekbones, large ears and large, lemon-shaped eyes. Whiskers and eyebrows are sparse to nonexistent.\n\nThe Sphynx comes in all colors and patterns, including white, black, red, chocolate, lavender, various tabby patterns, tortoiseshell, calico, bicolor, and pointed and mink patterns. The color is seen in the pigment of the skin as well as in whatever hair the cat has and can sometimes be difficult to distinguish.",

Sphynx are generally healthy, although the following diseases have been seen in the breed:\n\n\u00a0\n\nUrticaria pigmentosa, a skin disease that causes crusty sores on the body.\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a form of heart disease that is inherited in some cat breeds such as the Maine Coon. Heritability has not been proven in the Sphynx.",
    "history": "The hairless Sphynx is an example of the cat breeds that come about accidentally. A genetic mutation brought about the birth of a hairless kitten to Elizabeth, a black and white domestic cat in Toronto, Canada. Elizabeth\u2019s owner recognized that Prune, as the kitten was called, was unique and set about trying to reproduce him. He, along with other hairless kittens that were born in the mid- to late 1970s, was bred to furred cats, including the Devon Rex. The gene for hairlessness is recessive, so while some of the offspring were hairless, others had fur.\n\nOriginally known as Canadian Hairless Cats, according to The International Cat Association, breeders eventually settled on the moniker Sphynx for the unusual breed, a reference to the gigantic limestone sculpture in the Egyptian desert, worn smooth over the millennia through erosion by wind, sand and water. The Sphynx is recognized by the American Cat Fanciers Association, the Cat Fanciers Association and The International Cat Association, as well as other cat registries. Perhaps the world\u2019s most famous Sphynx is Mr. Bigglesworth, played by Ted NudeGent, in the Austin Powers comedies.",
    "personality": "It\u2019s a good thing that the Sphynx loves attention because he draws it wherever he goes. He is demanding of human attention and will do anything for a laugh. \u201cLook at me!\u201d is his catchphrase. That makes him easy to handle by veterinarians or anyone else, and it\u2019s not unusual for a Sphynx to be a therapy cat since he is so fond of meeting people.\n\nWhen he is not receiving the attentions of his adoring fans, the curious and energetic Sphynx is exploring his surroundings, climbing his cat tree or otherwise seeking high places, chasing a bug or just generally getting into mischief. He is extremely fond of teaser toys and puzzle toys that challenge his athleticism and brains.\n\nThis is a highly social cat. If you are gone during the day, the Sphynx will enjoy having a friend in the form of another Sphynx, another cat or even a dog. He likes the company and, equally important, he likes having someone to snuggle with so that he stays warm. He loves to be held, and you can expect him to sleep with you, most likely under the covers. Think of it as having a living hot water bottle.",

    "health": "Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Tonkinese are generally healthy, although they can be prone to gingivitis and may be sensitive to anesthesia. Because they descend from the Siamese, albeit relatively far up on their family tree, they may also develop some of the same diseases that affect the Siamese, including the following:\n\nAmyloidosis, a disease that occurs when a type of protein called amyloid is deposited in body organs, primarily the liver in members of the Siamese family\n\nAsthma/bronchial disease\n\nCongenital heart defects such as aortic stenosis\n\nCrossed eyes\n\nGastrointestinal conditions such as megaesophagus\n\nHyperesthesia syndrome, a neurological problem that can cause cats to excessively groom themselves, leading to hair loss, and to act frantically, especially when they are touched or petted\n\nLymphoma\n\nNystagmus, a neurological disorder that causes involuntary rapid eye movement\n\nProgressive retinal atrophy, for which a genetic test is available",
    "history": "The Tonkinese is the love child of the Siamese and Burmese breeds. The two breeds from Southeast Asia were crossed in an attempt to create a cat with a moderate body type, a less piercing voice than the Siamese but with loving nature and intelligence shared by both the Siamese and Burmese. But the story of their affair began with a case of mistaken identity.\n\nWong Mau, a small, dark-brown cat, belonged to Dr. Joseph Thompson. A sailor, knowing of Dr. Thompson\u2019s interest in felines, had brought him the cat, acquired in a far-away port. Wong Mau was at first thought to be a Siamese with a chocolate-colored coat. Such Siamese weren\u2019t unheard of. \u201cChocolate Siamese\u201d were described in the 1880s. Their bodies were tan or brown, and they had seal-brown or nearly black points. The seal-point Siamese, also known as royal Siamese, had lighter bodies that contrasted with their dark points and were preferred by breeders and the public. The chocolate-colored cats eventually disappeared in Britain, but they still existed in Thailand and Burma (now known as Myanmar), where they were probably the offspring of natural (as opposed to human-directed) matings between free-roaming Siamese and Burmese cats. Wong Mau was one of them. It was her destiny to become the matriarch of two new breeds: the Burmese and, later, the Tonkinese.\n\nThe first deliberate crosses between Siamese and Burmese began in the 1950s with Milan Greer, who called the cats \u201cgolden Siamese.\u201d He didn\u2019t continue his breeding program, but other breeders became interested in producing a dark-brown cat with points and crossed Siamese with Burmese to do so. The Canadian Cat Association began registering the \u201cTonkanese\u201d in 1967 and other cat associations eventually followed suit, although some, such as the Cat Fanciers Association, did not grant recognition until almost 20 years later, in 1984.\n\nThe name under its original spelling of Tonkanese was said to reference the musical South Pacific, which featured an island where no one discriminated against \u201chalf-breeds.\u201d There was often confusion about the spelling, however, so in 1971 the name was officially changed to Tonkinese\u2014after the exotic-sounding Bay of Tonkin in Vietnam\u2014even though the cats had no association with that country.",
    "personality": "The Tonk, as he\u2019s nicknamed, is friendly, active and loving. If you think of cats as being aloof and independent, it\u2019s only because you haven\u2019t yet met a Tonkinese. He demands attention and affection and won\u2019t rest until he gets it. This is a cat who will follow you around, ride on your shoulder and be involved in all family activities. He likes meeting people and is not the type of cat who will be satisfied to stay home alone all the time. If you work during the day, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure he has a friend to keep him occupied, whether it\u2019s another Tonkinese or other cat or even a dog.\n\nLike his forebear the Siamese, the Tonk is brainy and active.

Along the way, a street cat from Kashmir was also involved in the process to help bring out the breed's distinctive tiger-like stripes.\n\nIn 1993, The International Cat Association (TICA) officially started to register the Toyger.\n\nEven though the Toyger got its start as a designer breed, some have ended up in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. Consider adoption if you decide this is the mixed breed for you!",

In fact, in many cases pet owners have trained their Toyger to play games of fetch.\n\nUnlike many other cat breeds, the Toyger is also said to enjoy playing with water, just like big cat tigers in the wild!",

The length of the coat varies, with the longest hair usually seen in the ruff around the neck, the \u201cbritches\u201d on the upper hind legs and the plumed tail. You may think of an Angora as being solid white, but the coat can also be other solid colors as well as tabby, tortoiseshell, calico or other patterns.\n\nBeneath the coat is a body that is firm, long and muscular. Legs are long, with the hind legs being longer than the front legs, and the paws are small, round and dainty, often with tufts of fur between the toes. The long tail tapers from a wide base to a narrow end.\n\nContributing to the cat\u2019s beauty is a small to medium-size wedge-shaped head with large ears that sit high on the head and are tufted with fur and large almond-shaped eyes that slant slightly upward. The eyes can be blue, green, gold, amber or odd (one blue eye and one green, green-gold or amber eye).",

It is found in pedigreed and non-pedigreed cats. Turkish Angoras are one of the breeds that may be affected by this disease.",
    "history": "The longhaired Angora cat is not the source for angora sweaters, although his fur is certainly just as soft and beautiful. This natural breed takes his name from the city of Ankara in Turkey, which was formerly known as Angora. For centuries, the cats have been attractive souvenirs for invaders of or visitors to Turkey and may have been the first longhaired cats to arrive in Europe. One theory suggests that Vikings brought them from Turkey more than a thousand years ago.\n\nThe cats eventually became scarce and were saved only through a breeding program originated by the Ankara Zoo. Angoras were first brought to the United States in 1954. Breeders took an interest in them, but it wasn\u2019t until the mid-1960s that recognition for the breed was sought from the Cat Fanciers Association. The CFA began registering the cats in 1968 and granted full recognition to white Turkish Angoras in 1972. Colored Turkish Angoras were accepted in 1978. Today the cats are recognized by most North American cat registries.",
    "personality": "Beautiful and elegant on the surface, the Turkish Angora can surprise an unsuspecting owner with his athleticism and intelligence. No bookcase is too high for him to reach the top, and no closed door is safe from being opened by his questing paws. While he certainly can have lovely manners, the Turkey, as he is sometimes nicknamed, has an active, boisterous side to his nature, with a cleverness that makes him endlessly entertaining. He likes to play and will do whatever is necessary to get and keep your attention, even if it means getting into a little trouble.\n\nThe Angora keeps his kittenlike playfulness well into old age. He is friendly toward guests but loves his own people best. This is a sociable breed who is best suited to a home where he will have another cat or a dog to keep him company if people aren\u2019t home during the day. When you are home, the Angora may drape himself across your shoulders or settle comfortably into your lap. At night you\u2019re likely to find him next to you with his head resting on your pillow.\n\nTo live happily with a Turkey, you should have a sense of humor that matches his own, as well as a good store of patience. Once he gets an idea into his head, it can be difficult to change his mind about how he should behave, but he is so charming that you probably won\u2019t care. If you will, it\u2019s best to consider another breed. This is an affectionate, gentle cat who is devoted to his family, but his precocious intelligence, resourcefulness, desire for interaction and play, and short attention span may make him a challenge to live with.",

    "colorAndGrooming": "You might think that the Turkish Van is a white cat with patches of color, but genetically you would be wrong. He is, in fact, a colored cat with very large patches of white, a pattern caused by the piebald white spotting gene. The result is a cat whose body is mostly white, with colored markings on the head and tail. He may also have random spots of color on the body and legs. This type of coloring is sometimes seen in other breeds and is known as the Van pattern.\n\nColors seen in the breed include red, cream, black, blue, tabby in red, cream, brown and blue, and various shades of tortoiseshell. Nose leather is pink, as are paw pads, although they can sometimes have color spots.\n\nThe Turkish Van has a broad, wedge-shaped head with a rounded muzzle, moderately large ears with slightly rounded tips, and moderately large rounded eyes that can be blue, amber, or one of each color. As befits a cat who was formed to survive in a rugged landscape and climate, he has a strong, powerful body with a broad chest and shoulders and long, muscular legs. Males are much larger and more muscular than females.\n\nKeeping the Turkish Van cozy is a soft, semi-long single coat with feathering (longer hair) on the ears, legs, feet and belly, a ruff around the neck, and a fully plumed tail. Kittens and young adults have a less developed coat than mature adults. The coat doesn\u2019t achieve its full length until the cat is at least two years old. In summer the coat is short, but it becomes substantially longer and thicker in winter.\n\nThis is a large breed; they can take three to five years to reach their full size.",
    "health": "Both pedigreed cats and mixed-breed cats have varying incidences of health problems that may be genetic in nature. Turkish Vans are generally healthy, although some have been reported to develop a form of heart disease called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

    "history": "Known as the swimming cat for his propensity to play in bodies of water\u2014or at least to enjoy splashing his paws in it\u2014the Turkish Van is an ancient breed thought to have originated in the Lake Van area of Turkey. The mountainous and rugged landscape and cold climate of the region no doubt contributed to the development of the Van\u2019s cashmere-like coat and solidly built body.\n\nThe Turkish Van is a natural breed and has probably existed in his homeland for centuries. Legend has it that he swam ashore from Noah\u2019s ark, which tradition says landed on Mount Ararat in Turkey, not far from Lake Van.\n\nHow did the Van come by his spots of color? Both Jewish and Islamic tradition say that the cats were the recipients of a divine touch that imparted color to their formerly white coat. On the ark, a door slammed on the cat\u2019s tail, turning it red, and God reached out and touched the cat on the head, leaving a spot where his hand rested. In the Islamic version, Allah touched the cat on the back, and the spot that is sometimes seen on a Turkish Van\u2019s back is known as the thumbprint of Allah.\n\nHowever he came to be, the Van has been attractive to many of Turkey\u2019s invaders and visitors over the years. At least a few probably made their way to Europe as \u201csouvenirs\u201d in the past millennium.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the 1970s, though, that a Turkish Van was first brought to the United States. The International Cat Association recognized the breed in 1985, and the Cat Fanciers Association began registering it in 1988. In Turkey, the cats are considered national treasures, and their preservation is overseen by the Turkish College of Agriculture and the Ankara Zoo.",
    "personality": "When he is properly socialized in kittenhood, this is a social and affectionate cat who is strongly attached to members of his family, although he may choose one or two as his favorites. He is highly active and athletic, remaining playful into his senior years. Athletic doesn\u2019t mean graceful, however. The Van is big and ungainly; this is one cat who doesn\u2019t always land on his feet.\n\nTurkish Vans are highly intelligent and can learn tricks and games, including playing fetch. They like teaser toys that allow them to mimic pouncing on prey. And if you can\u2019t find your Van, look up; he is probably perched overhead, as high as he can get. Don\u2019t put anything on display that is easily broken; the Van has a wicked sense of humor and may enjoy pushing items off a shelf just to see what happens. Or sometimes he\u2019s just clumsy.\n\nThe Van may or may not be a good traveler. Trips to the veterinarian often involve the cat vomiting, peeing or pooping in the car. If you like to RV or take road trips with your cat, ask the breeder if cats in her line are prone to carsickness.\n\nThe Van\u2019s love of water can lead him into trouble. Put down toilet seats and cover swimming pools and spas if you aren\u2019t there to supervise his aquatic excursions. And resign yourself to finding your faucets dripping. He can easily learn to turn them on so he can drink from them or play in the sink. It\u2019s not unusual for a Van to simply enjoy lying in water, especially during hot weather.\n\nA Van dislikes being held or restrained, and it is a rule at cat shows that the cats are displayed on the table instead of being held up in the air. Most notably, if you are ever unsure of how a Van is feeling, pay attention to his Vanometer. That pretty shell-pink nose will start to turn red if your Turkish Van is upset. If his nose shading from pink to crimson, heed the warning and leave him alone.\n\nHe\u2019s not much of a lap cat, but the Van will be happy to cuddle next to you and sleep in your bed.

This will help keep the cat's coat in good condition and also ward off the chances of mats forming, which is always something to watch out for with long-haired felines.\n\nIn terms of climate, most York Chocolates are fairly adaptable felines. Just remember to always make sure that there's enough shade and fresh water available during the hotter months.",
    "health": "York Chocolates are generally considered to be healthy cats, but always schedule regular wellness visits with your cat's vet.\n\nThere aren't any breed specific health problems associated with the York Chocolate, but make sure to keep an eye out for signs that your cat might be in distress or pain.",
    "history": "The story of the York Chocolate begins in 1983 when a black-and-white feline and an all-black farm cat mated and managed to produce a litter that included a brown kitten. The owner of the farm, Janet Chiefari, named the kitten Brownie. Eventually, Chiefari began breeding these fluffy-looking, chocolate brown kitties with long-haired coats.\n\nThe York Chocolate was officially granted championship status by the Cat Fanciers' Federation in 1995.\n\nThese days, you can find York Chocolates in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. So make sure to consider adoption if you decide that this is the breed for you!",
    "personality": "When you adopt a York Chocolate, be aware that this cat will always want to follow you around and be part of whatever action is going on! Some owners even say that adopting a York Chocolate is a little like living with a dog.\n\nThe breed balances a playful side with a relaxed and affectionate side: The York Chocolate is definitely a cat who benefits from having extra people and other pets around to play and socialize with, but these kitties are also very much content to snuggle up on the couch or lounge on the bed for extended nap sessions.\n\nOn a day to day basis, the York Chocolate is a social feline who really does need company; this is not the cat for anyone who's away at work all day and leaves behind a totally empty house. You'll also need to keep the cat's excellent hunting instincts satisfied, so add smart, moving, and interactive toys to the living environment, and make sure to rotate them on a regular basis.",
